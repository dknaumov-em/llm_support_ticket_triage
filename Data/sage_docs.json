    "title": "Sage ERP 1000 Brexit - GB Businesses using Postponed VAT Accounting",
    "info": "Created on 11 December 2020 | Last modified on 23 March 2022",
    "content": "Summary This article explains how GB businesses can use Postponed Accounting in Sage ERP 1000 and Line 500 after the Brexit transistion period ends on 31st Decemeber 2020 Description Postponed VAT Accounting will be optional, arranged between the business and the HMRC. If used it will apply to imports to: GB businesses from EU and non-EU states For Sage ERP 1000 and Line 500 only the MTD functionality is explicitly affected. Resolution Postponed VAT Accounting (GB) If Postponed VAT Accounting is used, then VAT is not paid at the border and must be included on the Tax Return in Boxes 1 and 4. This should be the monthly figure supplied by the HMRC. Postponed VAT Accounting may be used for imports from EU states and non-EU states. VAT Codes VAT codes currently used for EC Purchases should be set up so that VAT values are not generated post Brexit. For VAT codes classified with Purchase EC set to “Yes” or “Supplier”, a new “mapped” VAT code should be created with a zero VAT rate and used against those VAT codes. An entry should be added for the new mapped VAT code in the System Directory for key CEVATHxxx1 (where xxx is the new VAT code); use the full 3 characters for the VAT code so that the “1” suffix is always the 10th character), and a value of “31/12/20 20.00”, this assumes that 31/12/20 is the Brexit date and the VAT rate is 20% at that date. Associated system key CEVATRATED should be set to EFFECTIVE or TRANSACTION. This means that for transactions using these VAT codes, the Purchases EC “reclaim” and “to pay” VAT figures will be calculated at 20% for transactions with an effective date / transaction date (depending on CEVATRATED) before 31/12/20. Those on or after the date will have zero calculated. Monthly HMRC figure(s) The monthly figure(s) supplied by the HMRC must be included in Boxes 1 and 4 on the Tax Return. It is suggested that a GL journal be added and posted each month to achieve this. If required to provide estimated VAT figures before the actual figures are known, then a GL journal(s) with the estimated figures may be added and posted; and a GL journal with the adjustment figures posted once the actual figures are known. Postponed VAT Accounting GL Journal Assuming system key NLVATLINES is YES, and VAT of 20.00 to be recorded: Note a standard Sales VAT code and a standard Purchase VAT code Raise a GL journal with an effective date and period in the correct (reporting) period Add a line for the VAT to be reclaimed. Amount = -20, VAT code = Sales VAT code and the VAT flag set to V Add a second line to offset this.  Amount = 20, VAT code = Purchase VAT code and the VAT flag set to V Post The 20.00 will appear under Sales VAT (Box 1) and Purchase VAT (Box 4) in the MTD GL detailed report If system key NLVATLINES is NO, then it is possible to enter a GL journal as above (but there is not the option to enter a Goods / VAT flag), the rate for the VAT code used should be large, e.g. 99,999,999. This type of VAT code may be used for VAT only invoices. The journal must be posted to the relevant period. If it is not normally possible to post ahead, then consider setting the NLPERSxxxx system keys to post to future periods for specific users, or setting the Start date on the MTD Tax Entity to pick up transactions from previous periods that have not already been picked up. CAUTION: GL Journal / VAT Register Issue There was an issue with the recording of the effective date in the VAT register from GL journals which meant that journals may be missing from the MTD report and figures. The date recorded was that of the journal date. This has been fixed in the following versions. Note that system key CEMTDINUSE should be set to YES if system key NLEFFDATE is NO.

    "content": "Summary This communication was issued 30 April 2020.  UKI CRM update for Sage ERP 1000 CRM connected customers Resolution Dear partner, Technology is always changing, including how Sage software works alongside associated software including Operating Systems & Browsers. Sage CRM is impacted by changes to the TLS protocol being made to browsers and operating systems. What are the upcoming changes? The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) no longer recommends the use of older TLS versions. Apple, Google, Microsoft and Mozilla have announced a unified plan to deprecate the use of TLS 1.0 and 1.1 early in 2020. We've recently posted a blog to outline some of these changes. Operating system changes to prevent the use of TLS 1.0 / 1.1 can also be expected but may impact businesses earlier, if the business IT policy removes the use of this protocol ahead of software vendors. What does this mean for my business & customers? Vendors of browser technology are actively working to deprecate TLS 1.0 / 1.1 technology and dates vary. Currently Sage CRM 2018 R2 is only partially supported for use with TLS 1.2. Over the next few weeks, software patches will be released for all supported versions of Sage CRM from 2018 R1 onwards, to ensure TLS 1.2 compatibility. Depending on what version is currently installed and how Sage CRM is currently used, steps, including upgrades , will need to be completed to ensure the software continues to work & services aren't disrupted.</> What are the key dates? TLS is not provided by Sage, the dates will vary dependant on the operating system, browser and business policy and as such is outside our control. What is the product impact? Sage ERP 1000 v4 & integrated Sage CRM Sage CRM only integrates with Sage 1000 ERP v4 and is reliant on the Sage 1000 API. For any systems where TLS 1.0 / 1.1 has been deactivated, either manually or via software vendors, new product installs and integrations to CRM will not work. We will be providing the following: Updated APIs for Sage ERP 1000 v4 SP10 and SP11 ERP 1000 v4 SP11 will be tested against CRM 2020 R1.1 ERP 1000 v4 SP10 will be tested against CRM 2018 R3.3 We'll provide further communications when the API and CRM patches are ready. When will the software be available? We plan to make all updates available no later than end of May 2020. Kind regards Jo Kirkup Product Manager",

Resolution Support consultants may request information about which Projects are enabled, values of System Keys, Binary Versions or even Database Connections as part of their investigations. The easiest way to obtain all the above information is by running a Sage Utility called csaudit which outputs the information to a single text file called csaudit.ld. To run this utility: Run a DOS CMD on the server Cd to the csserver folder – the location is dependent on the installation but is typically e:\\csserver for Line 500/Sage 1000 V3 or V4 or e:\\sage\\csserver for Sage 1000 V2.

We'd like to thank all of the partners who have engaged to ask questions and give feedback. We've built all of your questions and common scenarios into an FAQ . In addition, we have the following changes and announcements to make: Sage X3 We will be withdrawing all variants of SQL from new sale effective immediately - you have until 28 February 2021 to close any pipeline connected with this. NOTE: We will only supply SQL version 2017 to these final orders. We're working to distribute SQL 2019 in early 2021 to existing customers and this will include customers who have purchased SQL 2017 in advance of January 2021. It will then be the customer's decision as to when the SQL 2019 installation is performed. We'll remove maintenance from all X3 SQL renewals effective 01 April 2021 - this will be based on the customer's renewal date. You have until 31 March 2021 to add any additional users to the platform, where SQL is also required. Sage 200cloud SQL 2019 will be made available for new sales in the UK from 18 January 2021 and Ireland from 01 February 2021, and SQL 2016 will be withdrawn from new sale. Customers who currently have assurance will receive their upgrade notifications during the course of Q2 FY21. Prices for SQL in Ireland will increase from 01 February 2021. This has already been communicated to partners. We'll be changing the way the SQL product is registered on our systems - more information can be found in our FAQ . In addition, we're providing clarity to a number of scenarios and some partner recommendations on best practice. Please review the FAQ for further detail. Should you have any questions, please speak to your account manager.

    "content": "Summary This article documents the different parameters within the todbc.ini file. Resolution MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_SESSION Specifies how many database connections can be open at once for a running application. The aim of multiple connections is to improve performance. The first connection is used for all transactional work and the other connections provide a pool of read only connections to the database for queries. Each connection uses at least 40K, so the number of connections in use has to be handled sensibly. The default value for company databases is 5 (4 for SQL 2000), which means that each Line 500 user will use up to 5 database connections for queries.  The minimum value is 1. The default value is the best balance between performance and memory usage.  The default values for the CSMaster block is 2. If the value is 0 or if no entry exists, the number of connections allowed is limitless. THIS IS NOT RECOMMENDED. MAX_FILTERS_CACHED Limits the number of filter queries (or 'where' clauses) cached by the systems code.  This can be used to limit the memory consumption for a Line 500 session.  The higher the setting, the more memory will be used, but the performance should be better as fewer statement prepares will be required from the database. The default value is 4. MAX_QUERY_TIMEOUT Represents the number of seconds the system will wait before returning to a user prompt  (i.e. timeout) to inform them that a row is locked by another user. The default value is 5 seconds. MAX_DDL_TIMEOUT Specifies the time to wait for DDL SQL statements (i.e. statements that create and drop tables etc). By default it is not in the todbc.ini, so these statements will block indefinitely if they cannot perform their task.  Setting MAX_DDL_TIMEOUT to a value will timeout DDL statements after the specified time (in seconds).

    "title": "What is the new Plastic Packaging Tax?",
    "info": "Created on 15 February 2022 | Last modified on 10 March 2022",
    "content": "Summary This guide gives an overview of the upcoming Plastic Packaging Tax which applies to UK businesses from 1 April 2022. Description What's changing from April 2022? To encourage the use of recycled materials wherever possible, from 1 April 2022, the UK Government is imposing a tax on the manufacture or import of plastic packaging with less than 30% recycled content. Where the tax applies, it’s charged at £200 per metric tonne of packaging. Affected businesses must register ahead of time and start filing a special quarterly tax return. Who's affected by the changes? This affects UK companies but there's good news for smaller businesses. The threshold is 10 tonnes a year, so if the weight of packaging you import or manufacture is below this weight across a 12 month rolling period, the tax won’t apply. Once a business reaches the 10 tonnes threshold within a 12 month period, they must register for and start applying the tax in the following quarter. What do I need to do? To prepare for the new tax, we recommend you: Get familiar with the legislation details and speak to your suppliers to assess whether your business is affected. Consider switching to recycled materials so the tax doesn't apply. If the tax will apply to you, ensure you register with HMRC and start putting processes in place to ensure your business is compliant. To learn more, take a look at our blog or visit GOV.UK",

To see whether this is the case, check the following registry key: Check HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\csagent\\Parameters\\AppParameters If the value contains the string \"-x filename\" then scheme’s password is being stored in an encrypted file. For example: -y c:\\csserver\\Services\\csuserpwd - x c:\\csserver\\Services\\schemepwd \"DRIVER=SQLNativeClient;Trusted_Connection=yes;SERVER=S8\\live;DATABASE=csmaster;\" scheme To update the password you will need to carry-out the following steps: a)  Run a DOS-cmd and change directory to the csserver folder b)  Run the csmaster.bat c)  cd Services d)  Run crtxlogin e)  Enter the plain-text password for the scheme account f)  Enter the file-name for the -x parameter to AppParameters - in this case schemepwd Some installations may have an extra \"scheme scheme-password\" at the end of the AppParameters key.

As part of DA0199, Vendor Analysis, the option to drop completed orders from PO Period End was removed and it was only possible to clear them using the Remove Completed Orders Option. Without DA0199 it is possible to either drop the completed orders in PO Period End or Remove Completed orders depending on system key POINVCLR (set to A for Remove Completed Orders, set to P for PO Period End).

    "title": "How to write off bad debt",
    "info": "Created on 08 May 2020 | Last modified on 23 March 2022",
    "content": "Summary How to record the write-off of bad debt in Sage ERP 1000 and Line 500. Description How do I write off Bad Debts? Resolution What you need to do: There are 2 options in A/R>Tasks for handling with Bad Debts: Account Status Change – This allows you to do the following: Mark the customer as 'Despatch Held' and/or ‘Credit Stopped’. Update the ‘Account Type’ field on the Customer with a new value (‘BAD’ would be used in this example). Move item(s) from Debtors control to new Bad Debt Control Account via a G/L Journal posting. Allocate a Dispute Codes / Doubtful Debt Codes to the items with comments. Bad Debt Write-Off – This does the following: Create a journal transaction in A/R moving the original value out of Debtors control into the journal account. This option is useful to write off invoices that will never be paid (e.g. if the company has gone into liquidation). Optionally provides the ability to recover VAT, i.e.. whether or not any VAT amount should be journalled out of the appropriate VAT accounts. NB: It doesn’t allow you to do partial allocations or put in an open amount. The Journal Audit Trail has a flag to allow you to print write-off journals or not. Account Status Change Check the Transaction Enquiry and note that the 2 transactions have currently posted to the default control account. Go into A/R>Tasks>Account Status Change and enter BDTEST customer code. The important field to allow you to create the GL journal is the Update G/L? field. If you don’t have SLBADDDEBT set to UPDATE, you won’t see this field. The other 2 fields just control the display on a later screen. Select Confirm and you will see the items in question. Type y against the relevant item. You have the option to select all (F7) or individual items for the bad debt. Confirm. There are a number of fields here that are optional. The one to allow the journal to be posted is Account Type. Set this to BAD. In addition: You can also choose to put the customer on credit stop or despatch held status. The flags on the customer will be updated automatically with Credit Stop at -1 and Despatch Held=Y respectively. If you tick ‘Update Customer Account Type’ this will set the Account Type field on the customer to BAD (in this case). Be careful with this one. If the Debtors control is different in the new account set, any payments received against older invoices will update the incorrect control account. The Dispute code/Doubtful Debt sections are where you can mark the item and will appear in reports/enquiries. Select Confirm. A screen appears showing no of items posted/no of distribution lines. Select Confirm again to post the GL journal. Go back into AR Transaction Enquiry and select F12 More>GL Postings on the original invoice. Note that the postings have now reversed and posted to the new Bad Debtors account. The item will remain open. Any Doubtful Debt/Dispute codes should be displayed on the toggle. Note also in the Customer Enquiry, the fields Despatch Held is now set to Y and the Credit Limit is now -1 because I ticked the Despatch Held/Credit Stopped flags in Step 4 above. NB: There is an Account Status Change Audit Trail that goes with this option. Bad Debt Write-Off This option works in a similar way to a journal except you cannot partially allocate an item or enter an open amount. It will reverse the Doubtful Debt transaction using the Account Type (BAD) that you specified in the Account Status Change option and post to the journal account specified in this account set. In the example earlier, the Bad-Debt Write-off journal created after running Account Status Change posted as follows: credited the Bad/Doubtful Debtors control and credited the journal suspense (as per the BAD account set). You can use this option to write the invoice off completely and recover any VAT. It will not post to the Bad/Doubtful debt control account automatically. It will simply reverse the Debtors control and post to the journal suspense account. If you select y against ‘Recover VAT’ on the journal header, you have the option to select y again on the journal lines to recover the VAT (V column). The journal will the credit the original debtors account, and debit the journal suspense and the VAT control account separately. Postings will be as follows: Debtors Control 470 DR VAT 70 CR P&L 400CR With the VAT recovery set, the Bad-Debt Write-off journal will post as follows: Debtors Control 470 CR VAT 70 DR P&L 400 DR",

    "info": "Created on 22 September 2021 | Last modified on 23 March 2022",
    "content": "Summary This field is used in Sage ERP 1000 by MRP to ignore uninspected stock from fully tracked items in its reorder calculation when the Reduce Uninspected flag is ticked. Description Please note that this new key should be set to NO if either Advanced Manufacturing or Product Configurator modules are licensed and in use. Resolution This new system key is only available from Sage ERP 1000 V4 SP11 Patch 5. It is is now possible to set the Inspection Yield field to zero in Full Stock Details.  This allows MRP to ignore ALL uninspected stock from fully tracked items when the Reduce Uninspected flag is ticked in Generate MRP Recommendations. To enable this functionality the following must be set: System key STINSPECT needs to be set to WARNING or FORBIDDEN. The stock item trace flag needs to be set to F (Full) The mg and tc modules are not in use The inspection yield from the stock record is used to determine what quantity will be bad and the output adjusted accordingly. To see the new functionality in a test environment do the following: Set system keys STINSYLD0 to YES, STINSDPECT = FORBIDDEN and MRINSPECT = YES Inv Control – Create – Full Stock Details – Create a new product and set it to be fully traceable.  F6 x3 and set the Inspection Yield to 0 and confirm. Inv Control – Tasks – GRN – Book in 10 of your new  and mark them as fully inspected Inv Control – Tasks – GRN – Create a new batch number and book in 7x but ensure they are uninspected SOP – Tasks – Sales Orders – Create a new order for any customer for 20x your product with 0 allocated so a back order is created Manufacturing – Tasks – Generate MRP Recommendatons – Tick the Reduce Uninspected flag and the Create Diagnostics flag and press F6 for ranges.  Select your warehouse and product for your range fields and confirm. View the Diagnostics file and note that it has ignored the uninspected stock and recommends increasing stock by 10 Manufacturing – Tasks – MRP/MPS Analysis Report – Press F6 for Ranges and select your warehouse and product .  View the report and note the change in requirements is 10. Manufacturing – Tasks – Predict Future Stock – Select the product as before and tick Include MRP Recommendations.  Note the MRP buy is for 10. Upon installing Patch 5 the system key will default to the setting of NO which allows a minimum value of 0.01.  This is how the functionality behaved before Patch 5.",

    "title": "Things to consider after migrating to Sage Business Cloud Accounting",
    "info": "Created on 15 June 2021 | Last modified on 12 June 2023",
    "content": "Summary After migrating your Sage 50 Accounts data to Sage Business Cloud Accounting, there are a few points to consider that may impact the way in which you work, or how the data appears. Description VAT Cash Accounting: In those companies using VAT Cash Accounting you may notice two new Nominal Codes, these are 2208: Tax on Sales Holding and 2209: Tax on Purchases Holding. These two Nominal Codes are for VAT that has not been realised yet. In VAT Cash Accounting, you don’t pay or reclaim VAT until the Invoice has been paid and SBCA separates this money into these two Nominal Codes as forecasting for future VAT Returns. When the payments/receipts have been processed the amounts moves from 2208 and 2209 into your usual Sales Tax and Purchase Tax Control Accounts as normal As SBCA recognises VAT that has not been paid yet, unlike Sage 50, you may notice a difference in your overall Trial Balance figure. This is accurate and correct as it is including transactions that have not been acknowledged in Sage 50 for VAT yet Invoice Numbers In Sage 50 Accounts you have two areas for your invoices, the Invoices and credits module and the sales invoice (SI) transactions. As the Invoices and credits module is not migrated into Sage Business Cloud Accounting, this means the only reference to your original invoice numbers is from the reference column of the SI transactions. This means that when you migrate: The SBC Accounting invoice number is the transaction number from Sage 50 Accounts, and The original invoice number is in the reference column There is no way to change this, but you can choose the starting number for the next invoice you create. To do this go to: Settings > Invoice Form Settings > Numbering > Next Invoice Number. CIS In Sage Business Cloud Accounting you can activate CIS and submit your Returns in the software, there are no extra charges for this. If you would like to do this any of the companies where it is applicable, please use this guide, which can be found here> When you are raising invoices for Customers and Suppliers that are CIS Registered you must use the “Sales Invoices” option in Sage Business Cloud as “Quick Entries” do not offer the options for Domestic Reverse Charge In Sage 50 the 6000 Range within Nominal Codes are the default ones used for CIS (such as Labour, Materials etc). In Sage Business Cloud, the default nominal codes are different in SBCA and cannot be changed. You will no longer be able to use your old default Sage 50 Nominal Codes and will have to use the SBCA one’s going forward Making Tax Digital (MTD) Once you've migrated your data, if you're registered for MTD for VAT this must be re-enabled. To do this go to: Settings>Financial Settings>Accounting Dates & VAT. From here you can specify your VAT settings and enable the MTD functionality. Historical VAT Returns One change you may notice is that your VAT Return values for the past two years don't match exactly with your Sage 50 Accounts values. This is due to how the Migration Tool calculates the VAT information and Late Entry Transactions. When data is migrated, it doesn't take a copy of the VAT Returns within Sage 50 Accounts. Instead, VAT Returns are created based on any transactions dated within the period. This can sometimes cause a difference between what Sage 50 Accounts is reporting on the VAT Return compared to Sage Business Cloud. For example, you may have run the VAT Return for the period of April – June 2020 in Sage 50 Accounts and then had a late transaction posted in September but dated in May. In Sage 50 Accounts this would appear on the next VAT Return, but during the migration it would be placed into the Apr-Jun VAT Period. This does not affect any figures submitted to HMRC and you still have access to Sage 50 Accounts to view any previous VAT Returns. Nominal codes and control accounts When you go through the migrations process, we may need to assign certain nominal codes and control accounts to correlate with the settings in Sage Business Cloud, you may want to adjust these. This can be done in Settings > Financial Settings > Chart of Accounts. Here you will be able to change multiple aspects of the nominal code including the COA category, which is what causes the most common mapping issues during migration. Products and services When going through your migration validation it was explained that products and services are not transferred across during the migration. If you have completed your migration and want to set up your products again this can be done in two ways. You can export existing products and services from Sage 50 Accounts into Excel and then import them into Sage Business Cloud Accounting You can create products and services in Sage Business Cloud Accounting within Products and Services>New Item. This is likely more suitable for companies that had few or no products previously and want to get started. Departments Departments are not transferred across to Sage Business Cloud Accounting and any department references on transactions are set to 0. Departments exist as Analysis Types in Sage Business Cloud Accounting and you can enable these within Settings>Financial Settings>Analysis Types. Use of these analysis types is covered in your onboarding session. If you're using departments heavily we recommend you process up to a specific date, either the end of a financial year or month. You can then run departmental reports in Sage 50 Accounts prior to the migration and have a clean break to run reports after the migration. However, as the migration will not include departments it's worth discussing with clients as there is reduced reporting and no budgeting in Sage Business Cloud Accounting. Third-party software Sage Business Cloud Accounting can link with several third-party products to help you find suitable solutions for more bespoke business requirements. For more information, please visit the Sage Marketplace. Payroll integration Sage Business Cloud supports transfer of data between Sage Business Cloud Payroll and Accounting. However, if you currently use Sage 50 Payroll you can't use the Nominal Link with Accounting. If you're interested in moving to Sage Business Cloud Payroll, please get in touch with your Practice Success Manager to discuss further.",

    "info": "Created on 15 September 2021 | Last modified on 06 October 2022",
    "content": "Summary This communication was issued to our Sage 200 / 500 / 1000 / X3 and Intacct Partner community. Description Sage 200, Sage CRM and Microsoft Internet Explorer Notice 21-CV | 06 October 2021 Dear Partner / Developer, Technology continues to change at pace, that includes how Sage software works alongside associated software including operating systems and web browsers. To this end, we wanted to ensure that you are fully aware of the Microsoft announcement , dated 25 August 2021, which states that from 15 June 2022, Internet Explorer 11 (IE11) will no longer be supported. What does this mean for my business & customers? The Microsoft announcement signifies that Microsoft will provide no further updates, including those of a security nature. Whilst Sage 200 and CRM solutions will continue to work with IE11, other organisations, such as banks, may reject their use, due to the potential security risk IE11. IE11 is embedded within Sage 200 and Sage CRM, please refer to the sections below for further information. How are the products impacted? Sage 200 (All Variants) For Sage 200 Standard and Sage for Education, there will be no impact as all necessary changes will be included as part of our 2022 R1 releases. For Sage 200 Professional, the impact will be determined by what customers use, if any. Please see below for details: Using bank feeds No action is required for customers using Sage 200 Professional 2020 R2 release or later. Action is required for customers who use bank feeds on prior Sage 200 Professional releases. For customers affected, options include; Upgrading to Sage 200 Professional 2021 R1 Deploying a patch that Sage will make available for the following versions; 2018.00, 2018.01 and 2018.02, 2019 and 2020 R1. Please note; we cannot provide a definitive date regarding when individual banks may choose to stop accepting interactions from IE11. The information below has been updated since the communication was issued. Using Invoice Payments: Stripe, Payment & GoCardless No action is required for customers using the latest Sage 200 Professional 2022 R1 release. Action is required for customers who use Invoice Payments on prior Sage 200 Professional releases. For customers affected, options include; Upgrading to Sage 200 Professional 2022 R1 Deploying a patch that Sage will make available for the following versions: 2018.00, 2018.01 and 2018.02, 2019, 2020 R1, 2020 R2 and 2021 R1. Please note; we cannot provide a definitive date regarding when the organisations listed (Stripe, Payment & GoCardless), may choose to stop accepting interactions from IE11. Using the core product Sage 200 uses IE11 for a variety of features including, but not limited to the installation, self-service and workspaces. No immediate action is required where IE11 continues to operate in the environment in which the Sage 200 solution (both variants) is operating. Action is required for customers who pro-actively plan to remove IE11 from their environment. The options available to customers who chose to remove IE11 include: Upgrading to Sage 200 Professional 2022 R1 when released early next year - we will change to Microsoft Edge as the browser for functions that previously used Internet Explorer. Waiting for results of testing we are conducting to see if Microsoft Edge in IE compatibility mode will allow ongoing support. Sage CRM Sage CRM uses IE11 for a variety of elements. Over the course of several releases, we’ve updated the product to remove the reliance on IE11, and we are delighted to confirm, Outlook integration and document editing are the last components to be addressed, and this will be included in the upcoming Sage CRM 2022 R1 release, scheduled for early 2022. Therefore, no immediate action is required for customers who continue to operate IE11 in the same environment that Sage CRM operates. Where customers plan to pro-actively remove IE11, then upgrading to Sage CRM 2022 R1 release, will be required. Please note: Effective from the Sage CRM 2022 R1 release, there will be no testing or support for Internet Explorer. In addition, for versions still supported under our Product Lifecycle , should issues be identified with Internet Explorer, these will not be considered for defect resolution. Important Note: To ensure the best experience possible for customers, and to minimise the required upgrades, we’d ask that you also review our updated announcement around the Sage Licence Service which you can access here . Got a question? If your enquiry is of a technical or support nature, please contact the relevant support team in the first instance. Alternatively, please speak to your Partner Account Manager. Kind regards, Jo Kirkup, Product Manager Sage 200 Anita Holley Product Marketing Manager, Sage 200",

    "info": "Created on 10 November 2020 | Last modified on 23 March 2022",
    "content": "Summary The following instructions detail how you can change the tabbing behaviour within the detail line sections of a screen. Resolution A new Deployment setting was introduced in Sage1000 V3 and V4 called DisabledFieldsCopy which allows you to copy & paste greyed-out fields. To enable this functionality you will need to edit the \" JP112-HTML3.2\" Deployment Type within the Sage Web Client Administration program. 1) Launch the Sage Web Client Administration program 2) Select the 'Client Hosts' tab. 3) Click on the 'Deployment' button. 4) Select the 'Deployment Types' tab. 5) Hightlight 'JP112-HTML3.2' then click on the 'Edit Deployment Type' button. 6) Select 'Menu and Application Clients' from the 'Deployment Code Sections' dropdown box. 7) Add the following parameters ensuring that the DisabledFieldsCopy param is first: <PARAM NAME = DisabledFieldsCopy VALUE=\"Y\"> Unfortunately, configuring this Deployment setting causes an issue in a number of options when tabbing through the detail line sections. Instead of tabbing through only the Active fields, it now tabs through Inactive fields as well. To resolve this issue a parameter called SkipDisabledFields was introduced and this provides more flexibility. There are three possible values it can be set to: None, Blank and All. <PARAM NAME = SkipDisabledFields VALUE =\"None\"> Will not skip any fields when tabbing. So it will tab through active fields, inactive fields and blank fields. <PARAM NAME = SkipDisabledFields VALUE =\"Blank\"> This will skip blank fields when tabbing. It will tab through active and inactive fields. <PARAM NAME = SkipDisabledFields VALUE =\"All\"> Will only tab between the active fields. CAUTION: Setting SkipDisabledFields to \"All\" will not work if it is before the DisabledFieldsCopy parameter in the list.",

    "content": "Summary What causes the MTD Submit button greyed out Resolution Sage ERP 1000 V4 SP10 Patch 3 Sage ERP 1000 V3 SP13 Patch 3 The above releases introduced a change so that the FCEFramework installer is now automatically installed by the Java client. The change was made to stop people from installing an incorrect version of the FCEFramework (from a different service pack) as this would cause the Submit button to be greyed out. If running these versions or later, the following components need to be installed on a user’s machine who will be making a submission: MTD For VAT Module SageMTDFCE Java Client There are a few reasons why the MTD Submission button may be greyed out on a user’s machine. The first thing to check is whether the following dlls have been registered successfully by the installation: C:\\SageERP1000JavaClient\\CSdotnet.dll C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Sage\\SageMTDFCE\\MTD.dll To do this, launch a command prompt (using ‘Run as Administrator’) and go into each directory and run the following batch files: C:\\SageERP1000JavaClient\\setreg_framework.bat C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Sage\\SageMTDFCE\\setreg.bat This will run the batch file used by the installation to register the files. If they do not register successfully, it will return an error detailing the cause of the problem (registry or directory permissions, .NET not installed etc). If no error is returned, retest the problem. If the above does not resolve the issue, then uninstall the following components via Control Panel > Programs and then re-install (using ‘Run As Administrator’): Java Client SageMTDFCE Uninstalling and re-installing will ensure any previous versions of the FCEFramework installers are cleared out and the new version installed correctly. Earlier Versions of Sage1000 Prior to Sage ERP 1000 V4 SP10 Patch 3 and Sage ERP V3 SP13 Patch 3, the FCEFramework installer was installed separately and was specific to the service pack version the customer is running.

    "title": "Sage ERP 1000 / Line 500 - Temporary reduction in VAT for Gas and Electricity in the Republic of Ireland",
    "info": "Created on 26 July 2022 | Last modified on 17 October 2024",
    "content": "Summary On April 13, the Irish Government announced a reduction in the rate of VAT on gas and electricity from 13.5% to 9% to come into effect on 1 May until 1st November 2023. An announcment was made during the 2025 Budget to further extend the reduction until 30th April 2025. Description What's changing? To help businesses and households, the Irish Government temporarily reduced the rate of VAT that applies to gas and electricity from the reduced rate of 13.5% to the second reduced rate of 9%. This will revert back to the 13.5% reduced rate from 1st April 2025. Details of the reduction can be found on the Budget website . NOTE: This article provides general rather than specific guidance to assist all of our customers. We always do our best to make sure that the information is correct but as it i s general guidance, no guarantees can be made concerning its suitability for your particular needs . The information is valid at the time of publishing and is provided without any warranty of any kind, express or implied. You should take professional advice if you require specific guidance on your individual circumstances, for example to ensure that the results obtained from using our software comply with statutory or regulatory requirements. During this period you will need to ensure that you raise & record invoices correctly, depending on the classification of the goods/services. Resolution Important It is surmised that new VAT code(s) will be set up for the new 9% VAT rate. Existing Purchase Invoices not posted will not be automatically updated with the new VAT code(s) and therefore will be invoiced at the rate determined by their current VAT code(s). These will need to be manually changed where the new VAT code / rate is applicable. Any orders that require the new rate should not be added to the system until the changes to the VAT Matrix are complete. This guidance covers the purchase of gas and electricity. If you are supplying gas or electricity , ple a se refer to Considerations when amending the VAT Rate in Sage ERP 1000 and Line 500 Allow changes to the VAT code on Purchase Invoices There are likely to be occasions that the VAT code for a Product/Service will need to be changed so it is recommended that the system is set to allow this.  To do this Go to System Manager – General – All System Keys Enter POVATCHECK and set it to YES Essential In Sage ERP 1000 and Line 500 VAT is calculated by using a VAT matrix. The matrix will consist of a combination of Product/Services (Item VAT) and Suppliers (Account VAT), resulting in the appropriate VAT calculation (VAT code). Create new VAT code(s) for the new VAT rate. ~ Only one code is required but separate codes are often created for Purchase VAT.  You can do this as follows: Go to General Configuration – Create / Amend Master Files – VAT Configuration – VAT codes Enter a new code and confirm Enter a description of your choice. Enter the % rate of 9%. Ensure relevant nominal input and output account codes are selected. In the VAT Service field press F2 Browse and pick up your VAT service code. Add Item VAT type To calculate a Product/Service at the new rate of 9% a new Item VAT type needs to be required.  This code can then be added to the Products/Services.  You can do this as follows: Go to General Configuration – Create / Amend Master Files – VAT Configuration – Item VAT Type Maintenance Enter a new code and confirm Enter a description of your choice Add new Item VAT type to Products/Services To add this to a Product Go to Distribution - Inventory Control - Create / Amend Master Files - Full Stock Details Enter your product and add the code to the VAT type field on page 1 To add this to a Purchase Service code Go to Distribution - Purchase Order Processing - Create / Amend Master Files - Services Enter your service and add the code to the VAT type field Add new Account VAT Type If all Products/Services for a Supplier need to be calculated at the new rate of 9% or you have decided to have more than one 9% VAT code, then Account VAT Type(s) should be added as well.  The code(s) can then be added to the Supplier.  You can do this as follows: Go to General Configuration – Create / Amend Master Files – VAT Configuration – Account VAT Type Maintenance Enter a new code and confirm Enter a description of your choice. Add new Account VAT Type to Suppliers To add this to a Supplier Go to Accounts Payable – Create / Amend Master Files – Suppliers – Suppliers Enter your supplier code and add your new code to the Account VAT type field on page 1 Creating the VAT Matrix combinations The purpose of the VAT Matrix is to allow you to put together all the Item VAT Types and all the Account VAT Types into a matrix within which you can specify the resultant VAT Code that should be used for all the combinations.  You will need to ensure that existing Account and Item VAT Types are also taken into consideration. To add a combination for your new Item VAT Type Go to General Configuration – Create / Amend Master Files – VAT Configuration – VAT Matrix Maintenance Enter your new Item VAT Type into the VAT Type of Stock/Service field Leave the VAT Type of Customer/Supplier blank and confirm Add a new description In the VAT code field enter the new 9% VAT code Repeat this for all the Item and Account Type combinations that require the new VAT rate. Pressing F2 Browse in the VAT Matrix Maintenance option allows you to see what matrix records have already been set up. Pressing F3 Browse in the VAT Matrix Maintenance option allows you to see all the Item and Account VAT Types that are on the system Check List Keep a list of any changes you make in the product as they will need to be changed at the end of the period (6 months) Considerations Credit Notes Any credit notes created for invoices posted before the changes will need to be manually checked to ensure that the correct VAT rate is picked up. CAUTION: Keep a list of any changes you make in the product as they will need to be changed at the end of the period the lower rate applies for.",

Customers who use the impacted combinations will need to choose one or more of the following: Upgrade the operating system on computer being used for submissions. Submit using a supported operating system within their network. Install Sage software on a computer with supported operating system: Sage 50 Accounts software Sage 50 Payroll software Sage MTD for VAT Submission module The way in which the Sage MTD for VAT module works, means the changes being introduced in May don’t currently impact submissions made via the module, so long as the computer being used for the submission, has a currently supported Cipher suite installed. Ciphers in this case are part of a handshake chain that is used to encrypt data in transit, in this case between our client application, via an embedded browser, to the HMRC services. The operating system has a set of cipher suites that it supports, the client application may also define its own cipher preference and the service you are connecting to has ciphers that it supports. When the initial handshake occurs the Client Application, Operating System and Service you are connecting to all need to agree on a cipher they all support in order for the connection to work. Reminder on VAT Submissions (in product) We wanted to remind you that changes introduced by HMRC in November 2023 mean that in product VAT submissions from Sage 50 v28.0 or below, and Sage 200 Spring 2018 up to and including 2021 R1 are no longer possible as the embedded browser in use is Internet Explorer. A copy of the communication regarding this is available here . Are you communicating with customers? Yes, we’ve communicated to all customers where we’ve identified that they are doing a submission from a affected operating system. You can see a copy of the communication here . In all cases customers will be directed to their support provider for more information.",

Adding the Country Code If DA0370 is licensed (mandatory in Sage 1000), the new country code ‘XI’ should be added as an EC state using the EC State Maintenance option under General Configuration, Create/Amend Master Files, Company Configuration. For companies based in NI, the same VAT registration number should be entered as for EC state ‘GB’. The Intrastat state should also be ‘XI’. If DA0370 is not licensed, the new country code ‘XI’ must be added to the VAT registrations in the system keys. The key will be VATREGXI and the value the same as the value of VATREGGB.  The new country code must be added using the Country Indicator Maintenance option under General Configuration, Create/Amend Master Files, Company Configuration Using the Country Code For companies based in GB There should be no changes required unless the Country of Origin is to be printed on sales order and purchase invoice details.

We’ll outline that they need to update to prevent disruption to their service. We wanted to let you know in case they reach out to you. The nature of the module is that it automatically prompts to update when you open the software, if you accept the prompt, it will automatically download & install the update.

    "title": "Sage ERP 1000/Line 500 - Reduction in VAT for Newspapers and Health products to Zero Rate - Ireland Only",
    "info": "Created on 16 November 2022 | Last modified on 16 November 2022",
    "content": "Summary On Sept 29, the Irish Government announced the application of zero rate VAT to Newspapers and Health products. Description The Irish Government recently announced the application of a zero VAT rate from January 1st 2023 for: newspapers and news periodicals, including digital editions Automatic External Defibrillators and period products all non-oral Hormone Replacement Therapy all non-oral Nicotine Replacement Therapy If the reduced rate of VAT applies to your business, there are some simple changes you need to make in your software. Follow the steps in this article to make the changes. Resolution Important It is at your discretion whether to use exisitng zero-rate VAT code(s) or generate new VAT code(s) for the new 0% VAT rate for these items. Existing Purchase Invoices not posted will not be automatically updated with the new VAT code(s) and therefore will be invoiced at the rate determined by their current VAT code(s). These will need to be manually changed where the new VAT code / rate is applicable. Any orders that require the new rate should not be added to the system until the changes to the VAT Matrix are complete. Allow changes to the VAT code on Purchase and Sales Invoices and Sales Orders There are likely to be occasions that the VAT code for a Product/Service will need to be changed so it is recommended that the system is set to allow this.  To do this Go to System Manager – General – All System Keys Enter POVATCHECK and set it to YES Enter OPVATAMEND and set it to YES Essential In Sage ERP 1000 and Line 500 VAT is calculated by using a VAT matrix. The matrix will consist of a combination of Product/Services (Item VAT) and Suppliers (Account VAT), resulting in the appropriate VAT calculation (VAT code). Create new VAT code(s) for the new VAT rate. ~ The following is only required if you have decided to generate new zer-rate VAT code(s) and not use existing VAT code(s). Only one code is required but separate codes are often created for Purchase VAT.  You can do this as follows: Go to General Configuration – Create / Amend Master Files – VAT Configuration – VAT codes Enter a new code and confirm Enter a description of your choice. Enter the % rate of 0%. Ensure relevant nominal input and output account codes are selected. In the VAT Service field press F2 Browse and pick up your VAT service code. Add Item VAT type The following assumes you are not going to use an existing VAT cod(s) or Item VAT Type(s) To calculate a Product/Service at the new rate of 0% a new Item VAT type needs to be required.  This code can then be added to the Products/Services.  You can do this as follows: Go to General Configuration – Create / Amend Master Files – VAT Configuration – Item VAT Type Maintenance Enter a new code and confirm Enter a description of your choice Add new Item VAT type to Products/Services To add this to a Product Go to Distribution - Inventory Control - Create / Amend Master Files - Full Stock Details Enter your product and add the code to the VAT type field on page 1 To add this to a Purchase Service code Go to Distribution - Purchase Order Processing - Create / Amend Master Files - Services Enter your service and add the code to the VAT type field Add new Account VAT Type If all Products/Services for a Supplier need to be calculated at the new rate of 0% or you have decided to have more than one 0% VAT code, then Account VAT Type(s) should be added as well.  The code(s) can then be added to the Supplier.  You can do this as follows: Go to General Configuration – Create / Amend Master Files – VAT Configuration – Account VAT Type Maintenance Enter a new code and confirm Enter a description of your choice. Add new Account VAT Type to Suppliers To add this to a Supplier Go to Accounts Payable – Create / Amend Master Files – Suppliers – Suppliers Enter your supplier code and add your new code to the Account VAT type field on page 1 To add this to a Customer Go to Accounts Receivable – Create / Amend Master Files – Customers – Customers Enter your cusotmer code and add your new code to the Account VAT type field on page 1 Creating the VAT Matrix combinations The purpose of the VAT Matrix is to allow you to put together all the Item VAT Types and all the Account VAT Types into a matrix within which you can specify the resultant VAT Code that should be used for all the combinations.  You will need to ensure that existing Account and Item VAT Types are also taken into consideration. To add a combination for your new Item VAT Type Go to General Configuration – Create / Amend Master Files – VAT Configuration – VAT Matrix Maintenance Enter your new Item VAT Type into the VAT Type of Stock/Service field Leave the VAT Type of Customer/Supplier blank and confirm Add a new description In the VAT code field enter the new 0% VAT code Repeat this for all the Item and Account Type combinations that require the new VAT rate. Pressing F2 Browse in the VAT Matrix Maintenance option allows you to see what matrix records have already been set up. Pressing F3 Browse in the VAT Matrix Maintenance option allows you to see all the Item and Account VAT Types that are on the system Check List Keep a list of any changes you make in the product as they will need to be changed at the end of the period(s) Considerations Credit Notes Any credit notes created for invoices posted before the changes will need to be manually checked to ensure that the correct VAT rate is picked up. Quotations Any quotes that are converted into Sales Orders will use the rate of VAT that was on the quote at the time of creation. This can be amended manually on the detail lines of the quote before it is converted or on the sales order lines when converted. Standard Orders Any standard orders that are converted into Sales Orders will use the rate of VAT that was on the standard order at the time of creation. This can be amended manually on the lines of the standard order or on the sales order lines when converted. Scheduled Orders Any scheduled orders that are converted into Sales Orders will use the rate of VAT that was on the schedule at the time of creation. This can be amended manually on the lines of the scheduled order or on the sales order lines when converted. Sales Order Header Discounts If OPORDDISC is YES, you need to consider the system key OPSPLITVAT if your orders will have lines of multiple VAT rates. This functionality has been modified so we advise that you check the binaries relevant to the Line 500/Sage 1000 version/platform before applying the changes. Specifically, OP, PO, SL, PL and CE. If any of these binaries have a date of 2014 or older then we strongly advise these to be updated to the latest binaries. Contract Management In Contract Management there are no facilities to make manual changes to VAT codes so you must enter new orders to pick up the new VAT rate.",

    "content": "Summary What is the field 'open balance consistency' used for within the General Ledger Detail and Summary Trial Balance reports? Resolution Previously when you ticked the 'consistency check' box, the system did not include inconsistencies for the opening balance transactions. If you now tick both the 'Consistency Check' and Opening Balance Consistency boxes, the system will check consistencies on all transactions including opening balance transactions. These will then be listed on the report individually. This was introduced for any inconsistencies within the opening period, so the consistency check was enhanced. The fix went into Line 500 (V7.0 MR 57097, V7.1 MR 57098). MR Details below: Problem: GL Trial Balance Opening Balance Consistency Check GL Trial Balance. If tick the Consistency Check option, the opening balances are not checked. Solution: GL Trial Balance. Introduced a new run time option to allow for opening balance transactions to be included in the consistency check. If ticked, this means that the opening balance transactions will be listed and the opening balance column left blank.

    "content": "Summary This article details the cause of the error \"Invalid Arguments\" when accessing the Tax Return Maintenance option. Resolution An \"Invalid Arguments\" error will occur when trying to access the Tax Return Maintenance option if you have installed the FCEFramework and are running Sage ERP 1000 V4 SP10 Patch 3 or later. Prior to Sage ERP 1000 V4 SP10 Patch 3, the FCEFramework installer needed to be installed on client machines wishing to submit tax returns via the MTD For VAT module. If the wrong version of this was installed on the client machine, it would result in the 'Submit' button being greyed out. To combat this Sage updated the Java client so that it automatically installs the FCEFramework for the same patch level as the Java client. However, if you do install the FCEFramework program in addition to the latest Java client, you will get an \"Invalid Arguments\" error. To resolve the problem, use the following steps: Uninstall the FCEFramework program. Uninstall the Java client. Re-install the Java client.",

    "title": "Customer Account Credit Limits",
    "info": "Created on 08 May 2020 | Last modified on 23 March 2022",
    "content": "Description What settings affect a customers' credit limit? Resolution When examining to determine why a customer is/is not* on credit stop you need consider the following settings: The customers' Credit Limit as set on the customer master which found under menu option Finance > Accounts Receivable > Create/Amend > Customers > Customers. The credit limit may be set to a specific value, for example, 5000.00.  Alternatively, it may be set to 0 for unlimited credit (the system checks for unpaid invoices and displays a warning message if necessary), -1 if credit is to be stopped regardless of the balance of the account or -2 for no credit checks to be made. OPCRLIM system key if set to YES means even if the customer is on Credit Stop; during sales order entry;  the pop up warning that is displayed can be overridden by the user thus allowing further orders to be placed. The following system keys also affect the operation of credit limits and checking of them is important to determine a customers’ credit status: OPOUTORD YES/NO to include the customers outstanding orders in credit checking? SLCREDGEN Specifies if customer credit limits are to be in Base or customer currency SLCREDCRN Specifies if a customers’ credit notes should offset their outstanding credit balance.  Default is NO. SLCREDDAYS No. of days an invoice can remain outstanding on a customer account before a warning is displayed during order entry.    Sales Order module will place a credit stop on any further orders raised in the system if there is an aged debt. SLCRCHECK Set to I if the credit checking routine is to calculate the age of an invoice from the invoice date, or the due date when set to D. Therefore, the logic is that if the item is in excess of SLCREDDAYS then all orders will move to credit stopped on next update ie: next time something tries to update the order, allocate stock, despatch note print etc. However : If your system is set up to use project DA1308 Credit Management Enhancements , the credit limit field is controlled from within the credit control customer screen (via F13-Controller). However, you can type in a numerical credit limit in this field, it will update the credit limit field within the credit controller details screen. Values of -1 and -2 cannot be used with Credit Management Enhancements. This is because a 'Credit check status' field has been added to the credit controller details screen which includes the following settings: S - Stopped (this replaces -1) U - Unchecked (this replaces -2)",

    "title": "Communication: VAT Online Accounts Closure",
    "info": "Created on 06 September 2022 | Last modified on 29 November 2023",
    "content": "Summary This communication was issued to our Sage 50 / 200 / X3 / Intacct / 500 / ERP 100 partner communities . Description This communication was sent 07 September 2022. Notice 22-GM | 07 September 2022 Since 1 April 2022, all VAT-registered businesses are mandated to follow MTD rules regarding digital record keeping and digitally filing VAT returns. From 01 November 2022, businesses will no longer be able to use their existing VAT online account to file their VAT returns. HMRC will contact businesses that still need to sign up to let them know they must sign up for Making Tax Digital (MTD) and use MTD compatible software to submit returns. Moving over to MTD for VAT is simple. Customers can find out more about MTD in our knowledgebase or our dedicated MTD pages . As a valued partner, we wanted to share the latest update with you and provide information on what this means for our product range, as well as letting you know about our planned activity with customers, so you can respond to any queries you receive. Sage Business Cloud Accounting Sage Business Cloud Accounting is fully compatible and compliant with MTD for VAT and does not require any add-ons like spreadsheets do. Sage Business Cloud Accounting users without an identified MTD token will be warned by email communications and in-product messages that they must now comply with Making Tax Digital for VAT rules due to VAT online accounts closure on 1 November. This includes registering to MTD for VAT on HMRC’s website and connecting their software to HMRC’s systems. More information on product usage can be found here . Note that businesses can still produce manual VAT returns for specific cases like choosing to use bridging software to submit their returns to HMRC, multi-company customers with a single VAT registration, or business that are part of a VAT group. More information can be found here . Sage 50 Accounts Sage 50c Accounts version 24.1 and above are fully compliant with MTD for VAT. The ability to submit an XML submission was removed in version 27.2. Customers using a version of the software that still allows an XML submission may still be submitting via this method or manually. Sage will display an in-product message to customers identified as submitting via the XML method advising of the requirement to sign up and submit under MTD for VAT by 1st November, directing to guidance on how to confirm they are using a compatible version of the software, and sign up and Submit under MTD for VAT. Sage 200 Version 2018 and above contains the MTD for VAT functionality. The MTD for VAT module is available for earlier versions and additional scenarios such as multi company submissions. Version 2022 R1 and earlier, contains the XML submission feature, however once the gateway is closed this will stop working. No customer communications are planned. Sage X3 Is fully compliant with MTD for VAT, earlier versions contain the XML submission feature, however once the gateway is closed this will stop working. No customer communications are planned. Sage Intacct Does not have an in-product XML VAT submission capability; therefore customers will already be using the relevant MTD submissions method. No customer communications are planned. Sage Line 500/Sage ERP 1000 Historically, has not provided specific in product UK VAT functionality. The ability to perform Making Tax Digital VAT submissions was made available to supported versions of Line 500 and Sage ERP 1000 in 2018. It is unlikely that customers using these Sage solutions will be using the VAT online account. No customer communications are planned.",

It is controlled by environment variable SLINVLOCKNEW. This should be set to YES when there are no users on the system, and the csagent must be stopped and restarted. The new functionality works by marking the batch \"in progress\" on the slbataudm file, thus doing away with the need for the SIINSTm temporary file in the OP Instant Print. One the invoice has been posted, the slbataudm record will be updated as appropriate. If, for some reason, the OP Instant Print aborts, leaving the SIINST batch marked “In Progress”, the batch may be released. This may be done by adding a new option, sl_batches_M, description “Batches (Manager)”, command “slbatch M”. An F2 browse has been added (in the Invoices list) to show batches “In Progress”, and these may be selected and released.",

    "title": "How do I calculate exchange differences when generating payments from payment lists within Accounts Payable?",
    "info": "Created on 08 May 2020 | Last modified on 23 March 2022",
    "content": "Summary This article details how to calculate exchange differences when generating payments from payment lists in Accounts Payable when using Sage ERP 1000. Description How do you calculate exchange differences when generating payments from payment lists in Accounts Payable? Resolution In manual Cash Entry within Accounts Payable, by default, any exchange differences are calculated automatically. However, if you create a Payment List and then generate the payments from that list (via the option Generate Payments from List ), you have to tick the 'Revalue Currencies' flag in order to calculate any exchange differences. If this flag is not ticked, no exchange difference will be calculated. Follow the example below to demonstrate this: Create a currency conversion from GBP to EUR (set as multiply (*) and 2 dp) for a 'Period' type currency then set the following rates in the current and subsequent period. So if the current PL period (PLPERIOD) = 08, set period 08 and 09 rates as follows: Period 08 rate = 0.723245 Period 09 rate = 0.731245 Set the system key PLCURRTYPE to be the currency type for the above currency, e.g. 04. Create a new supplier with an EUR currency and set the Payment type to 'Manual Cheques' (M). Create an invoice for this EUR Supplier for EUR 120.00. This will convert to £86.79: Run the Accounts Payable Period-End to 09. This will trigger the period 09 currency rate (run the Audit Trails first). Create the Payment List for the above invoice. You will need to enter the correct due date, remittance date and payment type and make sure 'All Suppliers' is selected for the Currency. Note that the progress screen still shows the currency conversion as £86.79 as no revaluation has been done as yet. Select the option Generate Payments from List and tick the 'Revalue currencies' box: Note that the Totals section (prior to printing) now shows the converted amount as £87.75. If the Revalue Currencies box had not been ticked, the converted amount would remain as £86.79.",

    "content": "Summary How do I return stock onto the system in Sage 1000? Resolution There are a number of reasons why stock may be returned. The following examples explain how to update the system with returned stock items: Returning stock via Purchase Order Receipts: Example A - returning products sent in error/incorrect items Example B - returning faulty items Example C - all items on receipt are incorrect Example D - goods found to be faulty after being booked into stock Returning Stock via Customer Returns or Credit Notes: Example E - returning items via Customer Returns (Inventory Control) Example A - returning products sent in error/incorrect items For this goods receipt, 10 items were delivered but 2 of the items were the wrong products. These are to be returned immediately, together with a Returns Note. The returned items will not be booked into Stock. On the detail line of the PO Receipt, the receipt line will be as follows: WH Product Qty Ordered Qty Rec'd Qty Returned Price More SP 000211 10 8 2 10.00 Y Set the More (to come) field to Y, to keep the order open until replacements are received. Select the relevant Returns Code for incorrect items for the Returns Note. Example B - returning faulty items In this example, all the items are received but 3 items are found to be faulty. These are returned immediately together with a Returns Note. It is decided that the 3 faulty items will be purchased elsewhere. Set the More (to come) flag to N to change the outstanding quantity and close the order. WH Product Qty Ordered Qty Rec'd Qty Returned Price More SP 000212 10 7 3 10.00 N Select the relevant Returns Code for faulty goods for the returns note. View the order in Purchase Order enquiry and note that the ordered quantity has been changed to the amended quantity. Example C - all items on receipt are incorrect All the goods delivered but it is found that the wrong items have been sent. Return all the items immediately, together with a Returns Note. Set the More (to come) field to Y. WH Product Qty Ordered Qty Rec'd Qty Returned Price More SP 000213 10 0 10 10.00 Y Select the relevant Returns Code relating to incorrect goods for the returns note. Example D - goods found to be faulty after being booked into stock This receipt has already been booked into stock but the manufacturing department have notified that 7 of the items received are of inferior quality and need to be returned. The receipt line must be entered as follows: WH Product Qty Ordered Qty Rec'd Qty Returned Price More SP 000214 10 -7 0 10.00 Y Select a Returns Code relating to rejected items. Select the transaction code as being that of the original receipt number. View the Purchase Order via PO Enquiry and note that the status has been changed from R to blank and the quantity outstanding has been re-instated. Returning stock via Customer Returns (Inventory Control) or SOP Credit Notes. Example E - returning items via Customer Returns (Inventory Control) This option would be used for Credit Notes where stock is being returned and would normally only be used if the Sales Order Processing module is not being used. If Sales Order Processing is used, goods would normally be booked back into stock via Credit Notes. Customer Returns are prefixed with R and the type recorded is RETN. Once the item is booked back into stock, the Goods In quantity is updated for the product. See screen below: Upgrading your licence Need a little more room?

    "title": "Error: \"spool queue \"tetra\" is full\"",
    "info": "Created on 08 May 2020 | Last modified on 23 March 2022",
    "content": "Summary This message is displayed in Sage ERP & Line 500 when an application cannot add a new Spool Job to the Sage Spool Queue. Resolution Sage applications submit Spool Jobs to the Sage Spool Queue, and these are then automatically submitted to the relevant Printer, or Deferred for later submission or viewing through Spooler Management or Print Spooled Reports options. Each Job is given a unique name which is based on the User's name plus a 3-digit Job Number ranging from 000 to 999. If the last Job’s number for the User is 999, the Sage Spooler will try to \"wrap round\" and start again from 000 – if the Spooler cannot find a number which doesn’t have a Spool Job associated with it, then it will display the “spool queue full” message. There are four ways of clearing the spool queue: 1) Delete Spool Jobs If certain Users are experiencing this problem, then they should delete their oldest Spool Jobs to free-up “slots” for future Spool Jobs. This is only a short-term fix, as the User will probably “fill the gaps” quite quickly unless a lot of old Jobs are deleted. In order to delete all jobs up to a given Date for particular criteria, such as Owner or Paper for example, make sure a field called date is present on the Screen Form sp, queue_manager, sel_prompt - once this is in place, the criteria can be set, the Cut-off Date entered and then press F5 to Delete, and F5 Confirm Deletion and all Jobs satisfying those criteria will be deleted. This should only be done after a validated, up-to-date, backup has been taken. 2) Create Spool Queues On a Typical Installation, all Companies share the same Spool Queue (typically “tetra”), so a particular User could get this problem by having 600 Jobs in Company 1 and 399 Jobs in Company 2. If this sort of situation is likely to occur, the System Manager could look at setting up a Spool Queue for each Company so that *all* users could have 999 Jobs in each Company: Note that the existing Jobs  will remain – just type in the original Queue name. For UNIX Servers: Amend System Key SPOOLQ in each Company to have a unique value (e.g. demo, live_1 and live_2); Create associated spool-queue directories under the csserver spool directory; Copy the tetra.cmd to the new spool-queue names (e.g. demo.cmd, live_1.cmd and live_2.cmd) For Windows Servers Amend System Key SPOOLQ in each Company to have a unique value (e.g. demo, live_1 and live_2); Create associated spool-queue directories under the csserver spool directory; 3) Create new Spool Queues for each Year The same as (2), but all Companies could share the same Spool Queue for each Calendar/Financial Year – e.g. set SPOOLQ to tetra09 for 2009/2010 and then tetra10 for 2010/2011; 4) Users Each Sage User has a potential 999 Spool Jobs, so a new User could  be created with a slightly different name - for example, Jane’s older Username could be jane.mcd, and a new User jane_mcd could be set up for new Spool Jobs. This is the least practical. For options (2) and (3), the Print Spooled Reports options must be modified to reflect the change in Spool Queue name – for example, ce_print_spooled has the command “sqm local tetra ce” should be changed to “sqm local tetra09 ce”. To find all the “Print Spooled Reports” options, search for “sqm” in the Command and amend each one. If this is going to be a regular procedure, it would be better to replace the spool-queue with “-“  – e.g. “sqm local – ce”. Note that the other Spool Queues will still be available by over-typing the default value when the Printed Spooled Reports options are run. Upgrading your licence Need a little more room?

    "info": "Created on 23 March 2021 | Last modified on 06 October 2022",
    "content": "Summary To support businesses with their cash flow during the Coronavirus outbreak, UK businesses were allowed to defer VAT payments which were due between 20 March and 30 June 2020. If you deferred your VAT payments and you still have payments due, HMRC have announced a new repayment scheme to help you pay the VAT and avoid interest and penalties. Description Help us drive improvements. If you find this article useful, you can let us know now > Background UK VAT registered businesses who had a VAT payment due between 20 March 2020 and 30 June 2020 were allowed to defer the payment until a later date, without paying any interest or penalties. Subsequent VAT payments due after that period were due as normal, but businesses have until 31 March 2021 to pay the deferred amount without incurring interest or penalties. Repayment options HMRC announced a further VAT deferral payment scheme to help businesses repay the deferred VAT. Under the scheme, you could choose to pay your deferred VAT in equal instalments, interest free and choose the number of instalments that suits you, from 2 to 11. Applications to join this scheme closed on 21 June 2021 and for those businesses who didn't join the scheme, any deferred VAT outstanding after 30 June 2021 will be treated as debt and may incur a penalty.

Description NOTE: T he government delayed the date to which this legislation comes into action from October 2019 to 1st March 2021, more information can be found here . The way in which VAT is charged on construction services will change from 1st March 2021, as a result of new anti-fraud rules. This will impact domestic supplies (UK Only) where payments are reported under the 'Construction Industry Scheme', more specifically supplies of services that are Standard Rate (20%) or Reduced Rate (5%). Resolution The functionality is available from the following versions onwards: Sage ERP 1000 V4 SP11 Patch 3 Hotfix 2 Sage ERP 1000 V3 SP14 Patch 3 Hotfix 2 Line 500 7.1 OP71.227, AT71.126 and SK71.166 The set up for MTD, Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable and Purchase Order Processing is unchanged from the workaround for CIS for all versions.

    "content": "Description Error Received from Back-end: Program Aborted on Signal Trap: Signal 22 1 If SRD printing immediately returns the message \"Error Received from Back-end: Program Aborted on Signal Trap: Signal 22 1\" then it could be caused by a Local Policy setting. This could also stop Action Lists from working. The user associated with the Sage COM+ services needs to be present in the 'Log on as a batch job' policy in User Rights Assignment and this is added as part of the install. However, we have had situations where a Domain Group Policy excluding this user was overwriting this information when a policy update was performed. The COM+ services that require this user will then fail to operate. If you reassign the relevant user password against the S1000 SRD Reporting Services in Component Services, the problem is temporarily resolved until the next policy update is performed.  Reassigning the password in this one component will automatically resolve the problem for the other Sage Components Services because it adds the user back into the ‘Log on as a batch job’ policy. The solution in this example is to add the required user to the domain policy for ‘Log on as a batch job’ so that this user is copied across when a group policy update is performed. The services were not affected in this situation because they are managed under the ‘Log on as a service’ policy. Resolution",

    "title": "How does Consolidated Invoicing work in Sage ERP 1000?",
    "info": "Created on 19 June 2020 | Last modified on 23 March 2022",
    "content": "Summary This article details how the option Invoice and Credit Consolidation works Sage ERP 1000 and Line 500 and what to do if problems occur Resolution Invoice Consolidation consolidates invoices and credit notes where the following fields match. Statement reference Invoice reference Delivery point (if Legal Papers installed) Due date EC state details Settlement discount category Settlement discount percentages Settlement discount days Short name Comment only invoices flag Direct debit flag Produce invoices flag Payment method VAT register (if DA0370 licensed) Commercial papers Customer class Commercial papers Sales type Customer language (if using customer languages) Credit notes PPD flag (under specific circumstances) Additional criteria may be specified at run time. These are for: Industrial class Region Territory Price list Analysis codes A, B and C Ticking these will allow the values to be shown if they are on the print form but the system will not consolidate by these additional criteria. NOTE: invoices are only consolidated with invoices, and credit notes only consolidated with credit notes. NOTE: T he consolidation flag on an order defaults to that of the delivery point customer, although it may be amended in Order and Invoice Entry. In this option, the first stage is the consolidation pass, marking orders selected for consolidation to be status 8 (Invoiced) and generating the consolidated orders at status C (Consolidated). The exception is where an order is selected for consolidation but there are no other 'matching' orders to be consolidated with, in which case a consolidated order is not generated and the selected order stays at status 7 (Despatch Note Sent). The likely number of GL Posting lines are also checked at this stage.  The maximum number of lines per consolidated invoice is 9990.  If an order is likely to exceed this limit it will start a new consolidated invoice.  If the option should abort during this stage, the data will roll back to the start.  Click here for more informtion. The second stage generates invoices for the consolidated orders and any orders selected for consolidation that were not consolidated (see above). It will also include 'normal' invoices if the run time option 'Include normal' is ticked. In this stage, each order processed is a separate transaction, so if the option aborts, the data will will back to after the last processed order. If the second stage aborts at the start, for example if the spool queue is full , the Consolidation can be re-run with the same run time options and the second stage will pick up the relevant orders. The exception to this is if it was initially run with a specific order number range, in which case the user would need to consider extending this range to cover the generated consolidated order numbers. If the second stage aborts midway, then the resulting AR Invoice Batch may be manually posted, and the invoices reprinted for the batch (see system key OPREPRINV). The option can then be re-run, as above, and this should pick up the remaining orders. Note that the option knows whether a consolidated order has been invoiced or not by checking the invoice number field for that order. Delivery Address If you consolidate orders where any of the delivery address lines are different, the whole delivery address on the consolidated order is blanked out.  This is because it has no way of knowing which delivery address to take.  There is no way to prevent parts of the delivery address being manually amended on a back order.",

Notice 23-HX | 10 March 2023 Sage Line 500 & Sage ERP 1000 Product Retirement Update Dear Partner, We wanted to provide you with the latest updates connected to the retirement of Sage Line 500 and Sage ERP 1000, this includes an updated FAQ which covers: Migrations from Sage 1000 CRM to Sage CRM Licences for 3rd party solutions where a customer moved to historical or full use keys Product Lifecycle changes As of 01 October 2022, the product moved into extended support phase two. The details of which, are outlined in our Lifecycle Policy . Module Sales We wanted to remind you that the last date to purchase additional modules was 31 December 2022. Additional users can be purchased until the product retirement on 31 December 2024. Customer Communications Additionally, as part of a licence review, we’ve identified a number of customers that have future dated licence keys. What this means is they have been granted a licence outside of normal process, this could be for a number of reasons. We will therefore write to these customers to ensure they are aware of the product retirement, and, depending on what they are using the software for today, we’ll outline all they need to know and any action they need to take. This would include providing a copy of the relevant new disclaimer to customers using it for historical access, so they are fully aware of the terms. We won’t be asking them to sign them, and we’ll update our records to reflect the product usage type. We’re asking for your support with identifying the relevant customers to help to ensure that they get the most appropriate message to them. We’ll provide you with a list of customers with future dated licences, please review these and select the customers usage reason. We’d ask that this is returned to us by 07 April to [email protected] . We’d also suggest that you may wish to take this opportunity to discuss it with the customers in advance of them receiving a communication from Sage. Questions?

    "title": "Records and submissions under the new Plastic Packaging Tax",
    "info": "Created on 23 March 2022 | Last modified on 06 October 2022",
    "content": "Summary This guide explains the Plastic Packaging Tax, the records you need to keep and the information required to complete your return. Description This is a new tax that will apply from the 1 April 2022 to businesses that use plastic packaging manufactured in, or imported into the UK, that does not contain at least 30% recycled plastic. Plastic packaging is packaging that is predominantly plastic by weight. Resolution Who needs to register? You need to register for the Plastic Packaging Tax if you’ve manufactured or imported 10 or more tonnes of finished plastic packaging components within the last 12 months, or will do so in the next 30 days. There are two tests to check this that you can utilise from HMRC’s website , looking back at the last 12 months or looking forward to the next 30 days. TIP: If you're unsure what counts as plastic packaging please view HMRC's guidance . When do you need to register? Registration will not be open until 1 April 2022, but if you think you fall within this threshold you must register before 30 April 2022 even though the first report will not be due until July 2022. If you become liable for this tax at a later date, you must register within 30 days of becoming liable. When will the returns be due? Your returns must cover an accounting period. The accounting periods are: 1 April to 30 June 1 July to 30 September 1 October to 31 December 1 January to 31 March You must submit the return and pay any tax due no later than the last working day of the month following the end of the accounting period being reported. The format of these returns is still to be determined by HMRC but following these rules of what will be included will help you to determine what records you need to keep. However, this is just guidance and we strongly advise if this tax applies to your business you seek the advice of a tax consultant. What information will I need to include in the return? The total weight of finished plastic packaging components manufactured in the UK in the accounting period The total weight of finished plastic packaging components imported into the UK in the accounting period The total weight of finished plastic packaging components not subject to the tax in the accounting period The total weight of finished plastic packaging components manufactured or imported for use in the immediate packaging of licenced human medicines in the accounting period The total weight of finished plastic packaging components manufactured or imported in this accounting period which are due for export by you The total weight of any finished plastic packaging components that contain at least 30% recycled plastic content in the accounting period The total value of taxed plastic packaging components for which a credit is being claimed in the accounting period Credits will be for packaging components where tax has been paid in a previous accounting period and has subsequently been exported or has been converted into a different plastic packaging component. The time limit for claiming a tax credit is 2 years from the manufacture or import of the plastic packaging component. The total weight of chargeable plastic packaging components after deductions What records will I need to keep? There is a lot of detailed record keeping that you must now keep at a product line level, for at least 6 years in written (includes electronic) form. If you think you will be liable for this tax at any point, it would be good practice to start keeping these records now as you may be asked to prove why you are exempt. You must keep accounts showing how you’ve worked out each entry on your quarterly tax return. Where relevant, your accounts must include: A breakdown of the weight of plastic packaging components finished or imported in each period The weight of plastic packaging exported in the period on which the tax was deferred A breakdown of the weight of any plastic packaging for which a credit is claimed if the packaging has been: - Exported. - Converted into new packaging components. Any adjustments or corrections made to previous accounting periods — you must include the date and the accounting period they relate to You must keep accounts by reference to each ‘product line’ that you produce or import. A ‘product line’ is a group of plastic packaging components produced to the same specification. Your accounts must show how you’ve worked out the figures you submit on your return. Your records must show the evidence to support these figures. What records will I need to keep for products that are exempt? Plastic packaging components are not chargeable for Plastic Packaging Tax when they contain at least 30% recycled plastic as a proportion of the total weight of plastic. If you want to claim this exemption, you must have records that: Show how you’ve worked out the percentage of recycled plastic Provide sufficient supporting evidence that recycled plastic was used Show which dates the evidence relates to, such as the dates that the components were finished or imported Show which plastic packaging component the percentage relates to, including product lines or production runs Are an accurate reflection of the proportion of recycled plastic contained in the output materials of that recycling process Confirm the source of the recycled plastic What records will I need to keep for products that I am deferring tax on? If you want to defer paying Plastic Packaging Tax for components you intend to export, you must keep records that show you intend to export them. The records must be either a document: Used for any other tax or duty Which clearly identifies the components to be exported, such as a sales contract or order The records must: Be dated at or before the time of production or import Include details that allow the plastic packaging components you intend to export to be identified Include the weight of the plastic packaging components which you intend to export Further resources Further product specific information will be available soon in our Help Centre > NOTE: This information is subject to change from HMRC – You can find the guidance from HMRC here and this should be your source of truth when determining if you are liable for Plastic Packaging Tax.",

    "title": "Things to consider before migrating to Sage Accounting",
    "info": "Created on 15 June 2021 | Last modified on 09 May 2024",
    "content": "Summary Common questions you may have when considering migrating from Sage 50 Accounts to Sage Accounting (Sage Business Cloud). Description Do we have to start afresh? This is decided on a dataset-by-dataset basis with your Migration Specialist, but as a rule we will migrate 2 years’ worth of history. In datasets where there are barriers to migration, we offer an alternative route known as a ‘Shell Migration’. This is where we would migrate over the Customer List, Supplier List and your Chart of Accounts and you would need to set up Opening Balances within Sage Accounting for a date of your preference. Does it matter what version my Sage 50 Data is on? The Migration Service requires the data to be on Sage 50 Accounts v16 or above, anything earlier than this is no longer compatible with our current version of Sage 50 Accounts and therefore not compatible with the migration software. Can you migrate data from Sage 50 Accounts Professional? There are several features available in Sage 50 Accounts Professional that are not yet available in Sage Accounting. If you confirm that these features are not required, then yes, we can migrate these datasets. Do I have to wait until I have closed my financial year end or VAT period to migrate? No, unless there is a need or a want to do Opening Balances then we can migrate at any point during a period. Can Sage Accounting link to Sage 50 Payroll using Nominal Link? Nominal Link works between desktop products and you cannot connect your Sage Accounting data to Sage 50 Payroll. You can however post journals to reflect these transactions. If you choose to migrate your Payroll into Sage Accounting, then you can link Sage Accounting with SBCP. If my client or I use Bank Feeds in Sage 50 Accounts will this affect the migration? It doesn't affect the migration, but if you wish to continue using the Bank Feeds service in Sage Accounting you must disable bank feeds in Sage 50 Accounts first. This can take up to 14 working days to complete. Once this is done, you can set up Bank Feeds in Sage Accounting. Can I still integrate with Microsoft 365? Sage Accounting does not integrate with Microsoft 365 for emailing purposes. Instead, you can amend the company settings for which email you would like any documentation to be sent from. You can export data and reports to CSV to continue working with Microsoft Excel if required, but it does not have Excel Integrated Reporting functionality. How long does migration take? We try to migrate your data within 3 working days, however this is on a dataset-by-dataset basis, depending on varying factors which will be discussed and established in a validation call with your Migration Specialist. Can I migrate a client if they don't use Sage 50 Accounts and we do the processing for them? As long as you have a backup from Sage 50 Accounts, we can migrate your data. You can choose to continue processing for the client or, as Sage Accounting has unlimited users at no extra cost, you can invite your client to access the data to help with the processing. Sage Accounting also offers the ability to restrict access to users, therefore you can also grant your clients a read-only view of the data. Can I process while the data is being migrated? Although we cannot stop you doing this, we strongly advise against it. Anything processed during the time a migration is in progress will need to be reprocessed in Sage Accounting. How far back can I go in years, can you migrate everything? No, we migrate 2 years’ worth of history from Sage 50 Accounts to Sage Accounting. However, you will still have access to a read-only licence of the data held on the desktop. You can use this to run reports from the software and access any historical transactions if required. Will you migrate the data for me, or will I have to? You are allocated a dedicated Migration Specialist who can migrate the data for you. Further information If you'd like to know more about the benefits of moving to Sage Accounting and the advantages of it, read our handy guide now. Find out more >",

Resolution The field 'Posted Invoices will be retained after the date ../../..' is controlled by projects DA0904 and DA1161. These projects provide additional functionality around Transaction Extensions within Accounts Payable (as well as Accounts Receivable) invoice, cash and journal headers. Within Purchase Order Processing the purchase invoice header now holds the invoice date. This date is then used when running the Purchase Order Period End to select a date by which posted invoices will be retained. All posted invoices with an invoice date greater than the entered cut-off date are retained when the current period is advanced to the new period. Upgrading your licence Need a little more room?

    "title": "Purchase Requisition Authorisation",
    "info": "Created on 08 May 2020 | Last modified on 23 March 2022",
    "content": "Summary Our business has a procurement policy that requires departmental head authorisation on requisitions before it gets to the buyer. This means that approval/rejection is based on whether the item being requested is a necessity in their functional area or not. This article contains frequently asked questions. Description • Is it possible to accommodate that level of approval? • Is it possible to have 2 users authorising the same requisition at the same stage? • Can the same module be linked stock issues? Resolution The Purchase Requisition module can be set up to have authorisation the following levels: requisition, buyer, GL coding at budgets and also invoice level. The type of approval required at departmental level can be achieved at requisition level in this module. A requisition can have one of the following six statuses: 0 - With requester 1 - With buyer 2 - Awaiting authorisation (Awaiting value authorisation) 3 - Awaiting budget confirmation 4 - Authorised 5 – Complete Users can be allowed to raise requisitions so that they will be at status 0 and then the requisitions can be passed to the head of department for approval and if they are approved then they will go to status 1, when they are with the buyer. It is not possible to have 2 users authorising the same requisition at the same status, but it is possible to specify as to who the next user will be in the authorising process. Purchase Requisitions is not linked to stock; only when the requisition becomes a purchase order is it linked to the stock module. Upgrading your licence Need a little more room?

    "info": "Created on 08 May 2020 | Last modified on 23 March 2022",
    "content": "Summary What to do if the sync fails on the Trading Accounts entity with the error 'Balance forward must be Y or N'? Resolution Confirm the error matches the one below in the C:\\Portal\\sdata\\logs\\SyncResults.log file.  If it does then use the LinkID specified in the log file to identify the customer or supplier by matching it to the Acc_intforeignid value in the CRM->Account table.  You then need to check the balance forward field in the relevant table to make sure it is set to either Y or N.  If it is a supplier then check the balance_fwd_ind field in the plsuppm table for the relevant company and if it is a customer then you need to check the balance_fwd field in the slcustm table. If this is set to anything other than Y or N then you need to set it to the appropriate value.

    "title": "Why does Invoice Consolidation produce more than one invoice for a large number of orders?",
    "info": "Created on 15 July 2021 | Last modified on 23 March 2022",
    "content": "Summary Sage ERP 1000 has a maximum number of orders and GL Posting Lines for a single consolidated invoice and this article explains how these work Resolution The criteria for selecting which orders are consolidating is detailed here The maximum number of order lines for a single consolidated invoice is 9999. The maximum number of GL posting lines that can be generated for an invoice is 9990, that is 999 pages * 10 lines per page. If this value is exceeded when posting the invoice, the option will fail with a -3 (duplicate) error on a temporary table called opixxxxxt (where xxxxx is a number). This temporary table has the same structure as slinvm. The Consolidation functionality takes this into account when consolidating orders to ensure the -3 error is not generated.. If a consolidated order is likely to exceed either of these limits, then the order being added to the consolidated order will force the start of a new consolidated invoice (it will check all consolidated orders 'in progress' before starting a new one). Note that these are rough checks based on the number of order lines regardless of type or value. Firstly it determines the potential number of GL posting lines per order line. The initial default is 1. Then it takes into consideration the values for system keys OPCOS and OPNLANAL. If OPCOS is YES, then 2 extra cost related lines may be generated for each order line. If OPNLANAL is YES, then 1 extra VAT related line may be generated for each order line. OPCOS OPNLANAL Potential GL Posting Lines per Order line NO NO 1 YES NO 3 NO YES 2 YES YES 4 It then calculates the maximum number of GL lines to allow for on the invoice, this is 9990 (999*100) - 100 (the last figure is to allow for additional VAT postings), so 9890. Having calculated the above figures it will multiply the number of lines on the order by the relevant value in the table above, add it to (the number of lines already on the consolidated order times the relevant value in the table above), and compare this to the maximum number of GL lines. For example: OPCOS=YES and OPNLANAL=YES (4 potential GL lines per order line) Consolidated invoice C1 created to include Order A which has 1000 lines (possible 4000 GL lines). Order B to be added has 1000 lines (C1 now has possible 8000 GL lines) Order C to be added has 1000 lines - Consolidated invoice C2 is started to prevent 12000 GL lines on C1 Order D to be added has 2 lines.  This is added to invoice C1 (now has possible 8008 GL lines) There will be many occasions when the number of GL lines is well below the predicted amount. Due to the complex nature of the code it is not possible to be predict with greater accuracy of the number of GL lines. If the customer requires fewer consolidated invoices there is an environment variable called OPMAXGLLINES which can be set to a higher value to override the default check on the order lines.  Care must be taken when setting this variable as the limit for the actual number of GL lines is still fixed which means that the lines can exceed 9990 when posting the invoice, which causes the option to fail with a -3 (duplicate) error on a temporary table called opixxxxxt (where xxxxx is a number). There is also a system key that can control the numbner of order lines allowed called OPCONSMAX which allows the user to override the maximum number of lines on a consolidated order; useful for testing purposes. Absolute maximum is 9999.",

    "content": "Summary This article explains our current product approach to Plastic Packaging Tax (PPT) for Sage ERP 1000 and Line 500. Description In all references to Sage ERP 1000, the statements apply to Line 500. This is a new tax that will apply from the 01 April 2022 to businesses that use plastic packaging manufactured in, or imported into the UK, that does not contain at least 30% recycled plastic. Plastic packaging is packaging that is predominantly plastic by weight. You can see additional information with the Plastic Packaging section in our business legislation hub. This article explains our current product approach to Plastic Packaging Tax (PPT) for Sage ERP 1000. PPT is more than any potential information held or transactions processed within your Sage solution, it requires an assessment in terms of how it applies to your organisation, further review in your supply chain, processes, the information being capturing, record keeping in regards to stock and much more. As the story of PPT is still being written, no changes will be made to Sage ERP 1000 at this time, this is something we will continue to review and we have a survey available to understand your views. Sage ERP 1000 does not currently have the ability to support Plastic Packaging Tax in any capacity, including but not limited to records and calculations. At this time, it would be most appropriate to keep detailed records outside of Sage ERP 1000 and this should include doing a review of tax treatment to apply to products you are importing or manufacturing within the UK to understand if they are applicable to PPT. You may wish to consider using product group fields or other unused fields on the stock record (e.g. specific technical page records) to record PPT categories and weights and this may then enable use of the stock history to produce suitable information to assist you in producing your PPT return. Consideration may need to be given to stocking units and units of measure conversion Due to the nature of the tax, the complexities involved it’s important that you seek specialist guidance. As guidance evolves including information on the return, and information to be recorded on invoices we’ll update this article. Further information about PPT has been published on the Legislation hub > For general information about keeping records and submitting returns for the new tax, take a look at the following article > You can find out more about the Plastic Packaging Tax in our Sage Advice blog >",

In addition to this we saw problems where MTD client components had been installed on the application server, which caused the Staging Point to fail. To address this, a change was made to the Java client so that the FCE and Automation Frameworks will now be installed automatically.

    "title": "Communication: Important Information – HMRC Changes - Reminder",
    "info": "Created on 02 May 2024 | Last modified on 03 May 2024",
    "content": "Summary This communication was issued to our Sage Partner community for multiple products. Description This communication was sent 03 May 2024. Notice 24-NJ | 03 May 2024 Upcoming HMRC Changes Dear Partner, On 22 May we’re updating the Sage MTD for VAT module. This update contains important security changes to the embedded browser, which is used to complete the authentication and submission to HMRC. The module is used by a number of products in our range. We wrote to you in March to let you know about upcoming HMRC changes that will affect submissions from Sage 50 Accounts and Sage 50 Payroll. The changes will begin to be implemented from 07 May 2024 , so we wanted to provide you with a reminder. The changes are that certain Cipher suites will be removed from support – in this case its CBC ciphers. What does this mean? The Sage solution, the operating system and submission the customer is performing, determine the impact & action required. In broad terms older Microsoft Operating Systems - Windows 7, Windows 8, Server 2008, Server 2012 or 2012 R2, used in conjunction with the below submission types, will no longer be possible: VAT submission (in product) - Sage 50 Accounts CIS submission - Sage 50 Accounts EC Sales submission - Sage 50 Accounts RTI submission - Sage 50 Payroll What do you need to do? Customers who use the impacted combinations will need to choose one or more of the following: Upgrade the operating system on computer being used for submissions. Submit using a supported operating system within their network. Install Sage software on a computer with supported operating system: Sage 50 Accounts software Sage 50 Payroll software Sage MTD for VAT Submission module The way in which the Sage MTD for VAT module works, means the changes being introduced in May don’t currently impact submissions made via the module, so long as the computer being used for the submission, has a currently supported Cipher suite installed. Ciphers in this case are part of a handshake chain that is used to encrypt data in transit, in this case between our client application, via an embedded browser, to the HMRC services. The operating system has a set of cipher suites that it supports, the client application may also define its own cipher preference and the service you are connecting to has ciphers that it supports. When the initial handshake occurs the Client Application, Operating System and Service you are connecting to all need to agree on a cipher they all support in order for the connection to work. Reminder on VAT Submissions (in product) We wanted to remind you that changes introduced by HMRC in November 2023 mean that in product VAT submissions from Sage 50 v28.0 or below, and Sage 200 Spring 2018 up to and including 2021 R1 are no longer possible as the embedded browser in use is Internet Explorer. A copy of the communication regarding this is available here . Are you communicating with customers? Yes, we’ve communicated to all customers where we’ve identified that they are doing a submission from an affected operating system. You can see a copy of the communication here . In all cases customers will be directed to their support provider for more information.",

    "info": "Created on 10 July 2020 | Last modified on 23 March 2022",
    "content": "Summary Information on how to account for changes to VAT rates in the Sage ERP 1000 and Line 500  in the hospitality, holiday accommodation and attraction sectors.  In the 2021 budget this was extended to 30th September 2021.  A new rate of 12.5% will then be introduced until 1st April 2022 when the standard VAT rate will apply. Resolution Disclaimer This article provides general rather than specific guidance to assist all of our customers. We always do our best to make sure that the information is correct but as it's general guidance, no guarantees can be made concerning its suitability for your particular needs. The information is valid at the time of publishing and is provided without any warranty of any kind, express or implied. You should take professional advice if you require specific guidance on your individual circumstances, for example to ensure that the results obtained from using our software comply with statutory or regulatory requirements. For VAT, customs and excise and duties enquiries you should call the HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) National Advice Service Helpline on 0300 200 3700, contact your local HMRC offic e or visit their website at www.hmrc.gov.uk . In no event will we be liable to you for any direct, indirect, consequential or incidental loss or damage arising out of or in connection with your use of the information provided. Returning to the original rate on 1st April 2022 Using your check list you should amend the VAT Type of any products, services, customers and suppliers that have been set to use the temporary rate of 12.5% so that they pick up the standard rate of VAT as per the VAT Matrix. Alternatively, you can change the newly created VAT code(s) so that they have a VAT rate of 20%. New VAT code(s) for the 5% rate should be created so that they can be used for any late invoices or credits. The same considerations need to be taken as detailed for the change from 5% to 12.5%. What Changed in the 2021 Budget? To help businesses in the hospitality, holiday accomodation and attractions sectors, the reduced rate of VAT (5%) will apply to: Supplies of food and non-alcoholic drinks for consumption on premises from restaurants, pubs, bars, cafes and similar premises in the UK. Supplies of hot takeaway food and hot takeaway non-alcoholic drinks. Supplies of hotel and holiday accommodation and admission to certain attractions in the UK. If your business makes such supplies there are some simple changes you will need to make in your software to affect the tax rate applied on or after 15 July 2020. You can see which items are impacted by the change here . Specific government instructions around the VAT rate changes and what it means for day-to-day processing can be found here . During the 2021 budget, a further six months were granted until 30th September 2021. A new rate of 12.5% is to be introduced on 1st October 2021 which will run until 31st March 2022. Important It is surmised that new VAT code(s) will be set up for the new 12.5% VAT rate. Existing Sales and Purchase Orders and Invoices not posted will not be automatically updated with the new VAT code(s) and therefore will be invoiced at the rate determined by their current VAT code(s). These will need to be manually changed where the new VAT code / rate is applicable. Any orders that require the new rate should not be added to the system until the changes to the VAT Matrix are complete. Allow changes to the VAT code on Sales Orders and Sales and Purchase Invoices There are likely to be occasions that the VAT code for a Product/Service will need to be changed so it is recommended that the system is set to allow this.  To do this Go to System Manager – General – All System Keys Enter OPVATAMEND and set it to YES Enter POVATCHECK and set it to YES Essential In Sage ERP 1000 and Line 500 VAT is calculated by using a VAT matrix. The matrix will consist of a combination of Product/Services (Item VAT) and Customers (Account VAT), resulting in the appropriate VAT calculation (VAT code). Create new VAT code(s) for the new VAT rate. Only one code is required but separate codes are often created for Sales and Purchase VAT.  You can do this as follows: Go to General Configuration – Create / Amend Master Files – VAT Configuration – VAT codes Enter a new code and confirm Enter a description of your choice. Enter the % rate of 12.5%. Ensure relevant nominal input and output account codes are selected. In the VAT Service field press F2 Browse and pick up your VAT service code Add Item VAT type To calculate a Product/Service at the new rate of 5% a new Item VAT type needs to be required.  This code can then be added to the Products/Services.  You can do this as follows: Go to General Configuration – Create / Amend Master Files – VAT Configuration – Item VAT Type Maintenance Enter a new code and confirm Enter a description of your choice Add new Item VAT type to Products/Services To add this to a Product Go to Distribution - Inventory Control - Create / Amend Master Files - Full Stock Details Enter your product and add the code to the VAT type field on page 1 To add this to a Sales Service code Go to Distribution - Sales Order Processing - Create / Amend Master Files - Services Enter your service and add the code to the VAT type field To add this to a Purchase Service code Go to Distribution - Purchase Order Processing - Create / Amend Master Files - Services Enter your service and add the code to the VAT type field Add new Account VAT Type If all Products/Services for a Customer or a Supplier need to be calculated at the new rate of 12.5% or you have decided to have more than one 5% VAT code then Account VAT Type(s) should be added as well.  The code(s) can then be added to the Customer/Supplier.  You can do this as follows: Go to General Configuration – Create / Amend Master Files – VAT Configuration – Account VAT Type Maintenance Enter a new code and confirm Enter a description of your choice. Add new Account VAT Type to Customers and Suppliers To add this to a customer Go to Accounts Receivable – Create / Amend Master Files – Customers – Customers Enter your customer code and add your new code to the Account VAT type field on page 1 To add this to a Supplier Go to Accounts Payable – Create / Amend Master Files – Suppliers – Suppliers Enter your supplier code and add your new code to the Account VAT type field on page 1 Creating the VAT Matrix combinations The purpose of the VAT Matrix is to allow you to put together all the Item VAT Types and all the Account VAT Types into a matrix within which you can specify the resultant VAT Code that should be used for all the combinations.  You will need to ensure that existing Account and Item VAT Types are also taken into consideration. To add a combination for your new Item VAT Type Go to General Configuration – Create / Amend Master Files – VAT Configuration – VAT Matrix Maintenance Enter your new Item VAT Type into the VAT Type of Stock/Service field Leave the VAT Type of Customer/Supplier blank and confirm Add a new description In the VAT code field enter the new 12.5% VAT code Repeat this for all the Item and Account Type combinations that require the new VAT rate. Pressing F2 Browse in the VAT Matrix Maintenance option allows you to see what matrix records have already been set up. Pressing F3 Browse in the VAT Matrix Maintenance option allows you to see all the Item and Account VAT Types that are on the system Check List Keep a list of any changes you make in the product as they will need to be changed at the end of the period (6 months) Considerations Credit Notes Any credit notes created for invoices posted before the changes will need to be manually checked to ensure that the correct VAT rate is picked up. Quotations Any quotes that are converted into Sales Orders will use the rate of VAT that was on the quote at the time of creation.  This can be amended manually on the detail lines of the quote before it is converted or on the sales order lines when converted. Standard Orders Any standard orders that are converted into Sales Orders will use the rate of VAT that was on the standard order at the time of creation.  This can be amended manually on the lines of the standard order or on the sales order lines when converted. Scheduled Orders Any scheduled orders that are converted into Sales Orders will use the rate of VAT that was on the schedule at the time of creation.  This can be amended manually on the lines of the scheduled order or on the sales order lines when converted. Sales Order Header Discounts If OPORDDISC is YES, you need to consider the system key OPSPLITVAT if your orders will have lines of multiple VAT rates. This functionality has been modified so we advise that you check the binaries relevant to the Line 500/Sage 1000 version/platform before applying the changes. Specifically, OP, PO, SL, PL and CE.  If any of these binaries have a date of 2014 or older then we strongly advise these to be updated to the latest binaries. Contract Management In Contract Management there are no facilities to make manual changes to VAT codes so you must enter new orders to pick up the new VAT rate. MTD If reverse charge VAT is in use then please note: For items like accommodation a new specific VAT item type will need to be created for use with the VAT matrix with an account VAT type suppliers, to point to a new zero rated VAT code, and that VAT code would have a new mapped VAT code of 12.5%. These new codes would only use that in the relevant period.  Please see the MTD manual for more information on Reverse Charge VAT. Reconciling Your VAT Return A s part of this process if you identify an invoice where information has been recorded incorrectly, it’s advisable to correct the order rather than amend values on the VAT return .",

However, when checking the Interest Cross References in the F12-more option in Accounts Receivable Transaction Enquiries, no interest list can be found for these items. The reason for this, is the following: If the system is set up to use Sales VAT Postings (Project DA1233), the VAT code entered in the Interest List Charge Generation option must be the same VAT code associated with the Interest Charge control account. When entering a Zero Rated VAT Code in the Interest List Charge Generation option which isn't associated to the Interest Charge Control Account, the invoice batch does not get updated with the interest list, which causes the Interest Cross References not to be shown in AR Transaction Enquiry",

    "content": "Summary When a price list is picked up for a sales order line the list price can be picked up from the price list or from the product record.  This article explains why. Resolution When the user enters a price against a product for a specific customer it denotes it as a special price, therefore the list price is taken from the stock record (as there is no non customer specific price on the price list). The special price becomes the discount price on the sales order. When you enter a price on a Price List which is not specific to a customer, this just denotes a standard price, so that becomes the List price on a sales order and since there is no discount or special price it becomes the discount price.

    "info": "Created on 26 July 2022 | Last modified on 23 February 2023",
    "content": "Summary From 1st September 2023, the reduced rate for hospitality in ROI will revert back to the usual rate. Process What changed? To help businesses mainly in the hospitality, holiday accommodation and attractions sectors, the Irish Government reduced the rate of VAT from the reduced rate of 13.5% to the second reduced rate of 9% on a temporary basis. This will revert back to the 13.5% reduced rate from 1st September 2023. This change applies to: The supply of restaurant and catering services, guest and holiday accommodation. Various entertainment services such as admission to cinemas, theatres, museums, fairgrounds and amusement parks. Hairdressing and certain printed matter such as brochures, maps and programmes. Details of the reduction can be found on the Budget 2023 website . NOTE: This article provides general rather than specific guidance to assist all of our customers. We always do our best to make sure that the information is correct but as it i s general guidance, no guarantees can be made concerning its suitability for your particular needs . The information is valid at the time of publishing and is provided without any warranty of any kind, express or implied. You should take professional advice if you require specific guidance on your individual circumstances, for example to ensure that the results obtained from using our software comply with statutory or regulatory requirements. Important It is surmised that new VAT code(s) will be set up for the new 9 % VAT rate. Existing Sales and Purchase Orders and Invoices not posted will not be automatically updated with the new VAT code(s) and therefore will be invoiced at the rate determined by their current VAT code(s). These will need to be manually changed where the new VAT code / rate is applicable. Any orders that require the new rate should not be added to the system until the changes to the VAT Matrix are complete. Allow changes to the VAT code on Sales Orders and Sales and Purchase Invoices There are likely to be occasions that the VAT code for a Product/Service will need to be changed so it is recommended that the system is set to allow this.  To do this Go to System Manager – General – All System Keys Enter OPVATAMEND and set it to YES Enter POVATCHECK and set it to YES Essential In Sage ERP 1000 and Line 500 VAT is calculated by using a VAT matrix. The matrix will consist of a combination of Product/Services (Item VAT) and Customers (Account VAT), resulting in the appropriate VAT calculation (VAT code). Create new VAT code(s) for the new VAT rate. Only one code is required but separate codes are often created for Sales and Purchase VAT.  You can do this as follows: Go to General Configuration – Create / Amend Master Files – VAT Configuration – VAT codes Enter a new code and confirm Enter a description of your choice. Enter the % rate of 9 %. Ensure relevant nominal input and output account codes are selected. In the VAT Service field press F2 Browse and pick up your VAT service code Add Item VAT type To calculate a Product/Service at the new rate of 9 % a new Item VAT type needs to be required.  This code can then be added to the Products/Services.  You can do this as follows: Go to General Configuration – Create / Amend Master Files – VAT Configuration – Item VAT Type Maintenance Enter a new code and confirm Enter a description of your choice Add new Item VAT type to Products/Services To add this to a Product Go to Distribution - Inventory Control - Create / Amend Master Files - Full Stock Details Enter your product and add the code to the VAT type field on page 1 To add this to a Sales Service code Go to Distribution - Sales Order Processing - Create / Amend Master Files - Services Enter your service and add the code to the VAT type field To add this to a Purchase Service code Go to Distribution - Purchase Order Processing - Create / Amend Master Files - Services Enter your service and add the code to the VAT type field Add new Account VAT Type If all Products/Services for a Customer or a Supplier need to be calculated at the new rate of 9 % or you have decided to have more than one 9 % VAT code then Account VAT Type(s) should be added as well.  The code(s) can then be added to the Customer/Supplier.  You can do this as follows: Go to General Configuration – Create / Amend Master Files – VAT Configuration – Account VAT Type Maintenance Enter a new code and confirm Enter a description of your choice. Add new Account VAT Type to Customers and Suppliers To add this to a customer Go to Accounts Receivable – Create / Amend Master Files – Customers – Customers Enter your customer code and add your new code to the Account VAT type field on page 1 To add this to a Supplier Go to Accounts Payable – Create / Amend Master Files – Suppliers – Suppliers Enter your supplier code and add your new code to the Account VAT type field on page 1 Creating the VAT Matrix combinations The purpose of the VAT Matrix is to allow you to put together all the Item VAT Types and all the Account VAT Types into a matrix within which you can specify the resultant VAT Code that should be used for all the combinations.  You will need to ensure that existing Account and Item VAT Types are also taken into consideration. To add a combination for your new Item VAT Type Go to General Configuration – Create / Amend Master Files – VAT Configuration – VAT Matrix Maintenance Enter your new Item VAT Type into the VAT Type of Stock/Service field Leave the VAT Type of Customer/Supplier blank and confirm Add a new description In the VAT code field enter the new 9 % VAT code Repeat this for all the Item and Account Type combinations that require the new VAT rate. Pressing F2 Browse in the VAT Matrix Maintenance option allows you to see what matrix records have already been set up. Pressing F3 Browse in the VAT Matrix Maintenance option allows you to see all the Item and Account VAT Types that are on the system Check List Keep a list of any changes you make in the product as they will need to be changed at the end of the period Considerations Credit Notes Any credit notes created for invoices posted before the changes will need to be manually checked to ensure that the correct VAT rate is picked up. Quotations Any quotes that are converted into Sales Orders will use the rate of VAT that was on the quote at the time of creation.  This can be amended manually on the detail lines of the quote before it is converted or on the sales order lines when converted. Standard Orders Any standard orders that are converted into Sales Orders will use the rate of VAT that was on the standard order at the time of creation.  This can be amended manually on the lines of the standard order or on the sales order lines when converted. Scheduled Orders Any scheduled orders that are converted into Sales Orders will use the rate of VAT that was on the schedule at the time of creation.  This can be amended manually on the lines of the scheduled order or on the sales order lines when converted. Sales Order Header Discounts If OPORDDISC is YES, you need to consider the system key OPSPLITVAT if your orders will have lines of multiple VAT rates. This functionality has been modified so we advise that you check the binaries relevant to the Line 500/Sage 1000 version/platform before applying the changes. Specifically, OP, PO, SL, PL and CE.  If any of these binaries have a date of 2014 or older then we strongly advise these to be updated to the latest binaries. Contract Management In Contract Management there are no facilities to make manual changes to VAT codes so you must enter new orders to pick up the new VAT rate. CAUTION: Keep a list of any changes you make in the product as they will need to be changed at the end of the period the lower rate applies for.",

    "content": "Summary The following article details the ports used by Line 500 and Sage ERP 1000 installations. Resolution A standard installation of Line 500 will configure four ports during the installation: 38113 - Menu port 38114 - Applauncher port 20005 - Forms port 20001- TCR port It is a common misconception that these are the only ports required.  However, once a user has connected to the menu and opens an application, that application may run on any port, from 1024 to 65335.  Users that are not able to expose these ports to a GUI client should configure a Universal Client Staging Point server, which has this port range exposed to the Application server.  The Staging Point server should then be configured to use the 'HTTP' transport protocol to filter all traffic through port 80.

This articles explains how. Resolution The IBAN field must be set to 40 characters in all the supplier or customer maintenance screens.  It is a suspended field on the screens where it does not appear so they must be unsuspended, changed and then re-suspended. To  increase the length of the IBAN field for all suppliers to 40 in Sage ERP 1000 do the following: Open Layout Manager and copy the pl,supplier_maintenance forms from the master to your user form set if they do not already exist Open the pl,supplier_maintenance/ Page 1 form in your user form set and click on the IBAN field. Right click on the field and select Edit Standard Block In the iban:1 data line edit the properties on the right hand side so that the Character Length is 40 and press OK Save the form Open the pl,supplier_maintenance/ Page 2 form in your user form set Click in the Supplier Details section so that it is not highlighting any other field Right click and select Create Standard Block.  Select your new block and Right Click and select Edit Standard Block Click Add Component and tick the Existing Field box and select IBAN from the list Highlight your field in the box and change the Use to Data. Edit the properties on the right hand side so that the Character Length is 40 and press OK Now that the field length has been amended the iban field can be removed.  Click on the block right click and select Delete block Save the form. You can now log into Sage ERP 1000 and go into Accounts Payable - Create/Amend Master Files - Supplier Files - Suppliers and enter 40 characters in the IBAN field. To do this for the IBAN field for customers repeat the above steps on the sl,customer_maint/page 1, page 3 and page 4 screens.  It is already set to 40 on page 2.

    "title": "Business Partner - Sage UKI - CRM Update",
    "info": "Created on 05 June 2020 | Last modified on 23 March 2022",
    "content": "Summary This communication was issued 30 April 2020. Resolution UKI CRM update for standalone, Sage 200 / Sage 300 / Sage ERP 1000 CRM connected customers Notice 20-X | 30 April 2020 Dear partner, Technology is always changing, including how Sage software works alongside associated software including Operating Systems & Browsers. Sage CRM is impacted by changes to the TLS protocol being made to browsers and operating systems. What are the upcoming changes? The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) no longer recommends the use of older TLS versions. Apple, Google, Microsoft and Mozilla have announced a unified plan to deprecate the use of TLS 1.0 and 1.1 early in 2020. We've recently posted a blog to outline some of these changes. Operating system changes to prevent the use of TLS 1.0 / 1.1 can also be expected but may impact businesses earlier, if the business IT policy removes the use of this protocol ahead of software vendors. What does this mean for my business & customers? Vendors of browser technology are actively working to deprecate TLS 1.0 / 1.1 technology and dates vary. Currently Sage CRM 2018 R2 is only partially supported for use with TLS 1.2. Over the next few weeks, software patches will be released for all supported versions of Sage CRM from 2018 R1 onwards, to ensure TLS 1.2 compatibility. Depending on what version is currently installed and how Sage CRM is currently used, steps, including upgrades , will need to be completed to ensure the software continues to work & services aren't disrupted. What are the key dates? TLS is not provided by Sage, the dates will vary dependant on the operating system, browser and business policy and as such is outside our control. What is the product impact? Please review the sections below to identify the steps by product: Sage CRM Standalone The following versions will have a patch released: 2020 R1 will become 2020 R1.1 2019 R2 will become 2019 R2.1 2019 R1 will become 2019 R1.2 2018 R3 will become 2018 R3.3 2018 R2 will become 2018 R2.3 2018 R1 will become 2018 R1.2 Please update to these patches as soon as possible to ensure no business disruption. Sage 300 with CRM We are finalising the approach for Sage 300 and the following knowledgebase articles will be updated with details shortly. KB88873 : Sage 300 and CRM version compatibility KB45434 : Sage 300 CRM integration requirements Sage 200 CRM Sage 200 has several integrations. As the connector is no longer supported, the new Sage CRM patches will only be tested against the Sage 200 classic integration. Consideration will also need to be made around the recent TLS communication we issued. In all cases the CRM patches will be tested against the following recently released remastered versions. Sage 200 Summer 2017 RM with Sage CRM 2018 R3.3 Sage 200 Summer 2018 RM with Sage CRM 2018 R3.3 Sage 200 2020 R1 with Sage CRM 2020 R1.1 The support matrix will be updated as follows: Sage 200 Version CRM Version 2020 R1 2020 R1.1 2019 Summer 2018 R3.3 2019 Spring 2018 R3.3 2018 Winter 2018 R3.3 2018 Summer RM (Remaster) 2018 R3.3 2018 Summer 2018 R3.3 2018 Spring 2018 R3.3 2017 Winter 2018 R3.3 2017 Summer RM (Remaster) 2018 R3.3 2017 Summer 2018 R3.3 2016 SP2 RM (Remaster) 7.3 is not TLS 1.2 compatible and customers using CRM should upgrade to a suitable combination as soon as possible 2016 SP2 RM 7.3 is not TLS 1.2 compatible and customers using CRM should upgrade to a suitable combination as soon as possible Sage ERP 1000 v4 & integrated Sage CRM Sage CRM only integrates with Sage 1000 ERP v4 and is reliant on the Sage 1000 API. For any systems where TLS 1.0 / 1.1 has been deactivated, either manually or via software vendors, new product installs and integrations to CRM will not work. We will be providing the following: Updated APIs for Sage ERP 1000 v4 SP10 and SP11 ERP 1000 v4 SP11 will be tested against CRM 2020 R1.1 ERP 1000 v4 SP10 will be tested against CRM 2018 R3.3 We'll provide further communications when the API and CRM patches are ready.

    "title": "Sage ERP 1000 - CrowdStrike Anti-Virus",
    "info": "Created on 25 October 2021 | Last modified on 23 March 2022",
    "content": "Summary This artice details the issue with installing both CrowdStrike and Sage ERP 1000 onto the same server. Resolution We have become aware of an Anti-Virus software called “CrowdStrike” that installs a Windows service called “CSAgent”. This is the same name as the Sage ERP 1000 Windows service. If you are wanting to install CrowdStrike onto a server where Sage ERP 1000 has already been installed, then it is possible to rename the existing csagent service (belonging to Sage ERP 1000) in the registry. If you reboot the server, Sage ERP 1000 will continue to run without any problems. The below example shows the entry changed to “Sage1000ERPAgent”. The only issue with this is if you have to apply a Service Pack. The installer will try to delete and reinstall the “csagent” service. For the customer this will now be owned by the CrowdStrike anti-virus software. A site who previously reported this problem advised that the Service Pack failed to delete the “csagent” service (owned by Crowdstrike), but it is up to customers to test this for themselves. Updating the agents.bat file with your new Sage ERP 1000 service name cannot be used as a workaround to this issue, as the file is overwritten with a standard version when you apply a Service Pack. If testing proves that the csagent service (belonging to CrowdStrike) hasn’t been deleted, all you will need to do is reinstall your new “Sage1000ERPAgent” service which can be done by making a copy of the agents.bat, editing it to include your new service name and then run it from a command line. This process would need to be documented for anyone applying a Service Pack to the site in the future. Note – this is not the case for Patches. Patches do not delete and reinstall services. So if a site is running Sage ERP 1000 V4 SP11 they will only need to update the service in the registry as we only provide patches for this version. For sites trying to install Sage ERP 1000 onto a server where CrowdStrike has already been installed, it will fail to install Sage 1000 ERP Agent service. The only way around this is to uninstall Crowdstrike, install Sage ERP 1000, rename the csagent service (as above) and then re-install CrowdStrike.",

    "title": "Sage ERP 1000/Line 500 - Farmers and the Flat-rate Scheme - Ireland",
    "info": "Created on 16 November 2022 | Last modified on 11 October 2023",
    "content": "Summary As part of Budget 2023, the Irish Government announced the reduction of the Farmer's Flat Rate from 5.5% to 5% from 1 January 2023.\r\n\r\nThis will reduce from 5% to 4.8% from 1st January 2024 Description What's changing? The Flat-rate Scheme is a special scheme for farmers who are not registered, or required to register, for Value-Added Tax (VAT). These farmers are commonly referred to as flat-rate farmers. The scheme is designed to compensate flat-rate farmers for the VAT they incur on farming costs without having to register. Flat-rate farmers are entitled to receive an amount known as the flat-rate addition on their supplies of agricultural activities. On 1st January 2024, this rate will change to 4.8%. Further information on this scheme can be found on the Irish Revenue website . Current VAT Rates in Ireland can be found here . Resolution Important It is surmised that new VAT code(s) will be set up for the new VAT rate. Existing Purchase Invoices not posted will not be automatically updated with the new VAT code(s) and therefore will be invoiced at the rate determined by their current VAT code(s). These will need to be manually changed where the new VAT code / rate is applicable. Any orders that require the new rate should not be added to the system until the changes to the VAT Matrix are complete. Allow changes to the VAT code on Purchase and Sales Invoices and Sales Orders There are likely to be occasions that the VAT code for a Product/Service will need to be changed so it is recommended that the system is set to allow this.  To do this Go to System Manager – General – All System Keys Enter POVATCHECK and set it to YES Enter OPVATAMEND and set it to YES Essential In Sage ERP 1000 and Line 500 VAT is calculated by using a VAT matrix. The matrix will consist of a combination of Product/Services (Item VAT) and Suppliers (Account VAT), resulting in the appropriate VAT calculation (VAT code).

Quotations Any quotes that are converted into Sales Orders will use the rate of VAT that was on the quote at the time of creation. This can be amended manually on the detail lines of the quote before it is converted or on the sales order lines when converted. Standard Orders Any standard orders that are converted into Sales Orders will use the rate of VAT that was on the standard order at the time of creation. This can be amended manually on the lines of the standard order or on the sales order lines when converted. Scheduled Orders Any scheduled orders that are converted into Sales Orders will use the rate of VAT that was on the schedule at the time of creation. This can be amended manually on the lines of the scheduled order or on the sales order lines when converted. Sales Order Header Discounts If OPORDDISC is YES, you need to consider the system key OPSPLITVAT if your orders will have lines of multiple VAT rates. This functionality has been modified so we advise that you check the binaries relevant to the Line 500/Sage 1000 version/platform before applying the changes. Specifically, OP, PO, SL, PL and CE. If any of these binaries have a date of 2014 or older then we strongly advise these to be updated to the latest binaries. Contract Management In Contract Management there are no facilities to make manual changes to VAT codes so you must enter new orders to pick up the new VAT rate.",

Description Businesses in the EU and Northern Ireland with exports above the dispatch threshold must include the Partner VAT ID and Country of Origin (CoO) in their dispatch Intrastat reports from 1 January 2022. Read more > To do this, you can amend your dispatch report csv file once you generate it from Sage ERP 1000 or Line 500. Resolution Generate your dispatch Intrastat file As there are no changes to the Intrastat process within Sage ERP 1000 and Line 500, your first step is to generate your dispatch Intrastat report csv file.  This needs to be done from the UK Intrastat CSV option. Please note the UK Intrastat EDI option is now redundant and should not be used. When opened in a text editor like Notepad your csv file has a header line for the trader details and the information for the detail lines are listed below it. You should amend these areas by following the section below. Amend the dispatch Intrastat csv file On the header line, change CSV02 to CSV03 . For each detail line the VAT number of the partner operator (customer) and the country of origin must be included.  These should be comma separated and added immediately before the last field (trader reference) on each line The VAT number is a combination of the vatstate and the ecvatreg fields in the slcustem table.  The customer code for the line is held on the field clientcode in the isstatum table The country of origin is held on the country_orig field in the isstatum table.  This must be XI if the goods were made in Northern Ireland. Once you have obtained the required data, add it to the file and check that it is comma separated and in the correct position. Repeat for each detail line in the file. See two line example below You've added the additional information required and can now submit your Intrastat report in the usual way.",

NB: PORATEREC was introduced as part of a fix and is available in Sage ERP 1000 V3 SP9 and V4 SP3 onwards and in Line 500 v7.1. It is only relevant to purchase receipts, therefore can only be used if POCURRRAT is also set to YES. To use the currency period of the receipt date, set PORATEREC to YES.

    "info": "Created on 08 May 2020 | Last modified on 23 March 2022",
    "content": "Summary The following artice details how to increase Windows sockets. Resolution By default, Windows allocates a socket pool of 5000 which is shared between the Operating System and Applications. Heavily loaded systems, such as a large Line 500 system, will usually require the socket pool to be increased. General socket usage can be monitored via 'netstat'. Each row returned is equivalent to a socket. Of course, there could also be other sockets used by applications that are not registered in netstat, but it gives a general idea.   The socket pool can be increased to a maximum of 65534 via the REG_DWORD Registry key: HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\Tcpip\\Parameters\\MaxUserPort A high value will only have a small impact on memory usage. When a socket is closed it enters the 'TIME_WAIT' state and cannot be reused for the period defined in the Registry key 'TcpTimedWaitDelay'. The default value is 240 seconds, however, reducing this to the minimum (30) maximises the amount of socket reuse and therefore reduces the need to increase the socket pool.",

Resolution The signal trap 22 error has been raised many times in the past but it is a generic error which can mean many things depending on the specific circumstance. The one thing that it usually has in common is that the issue is with running an SRD report. To troubleshoot the problem: Check to see If all other reports are working Check if the same report works for users on the master and different form sets. If the report works in both this suggests that the users report definition may have developed an issue or become corrupt. To resolve the problem: Double click on the relevant .report file in csserver\\Reports directory this and try the report again If this does not work then rename the definition file so that the report can then generate a new one based on the standard forms.

    "content": "Summary This field is shown from Sage ERP 1000 V4 SP11 Patch 5 onwards to enable invoices to calculate Domestic Reverse Charge correctly when there is a separate CIS deduction on the invoice.  This ensures that MTD is calculated correctly without the need to create a separate credit note for the CIS deduction Cause In a CIS environment, as well as accounting for Domestic Reverse Charge, the main contractor often has to account for the CIS deduction of 20% or 30% for registered sub-contractors.  Most items can be purchased with or without the Domestic Reverse Charge (DRC) VAT rate on a regular basis so the solution is to set the CIS rate on the POP invoice header which then overrides the invoice line values from the VAT Matrix.  This works unless there is a invoice line for a CIS deduction which is not subject to DRC which also has its VAT code overridden and causes the VAT on the MTD Submission to be calculated incorrectly. Resolution This functionality is only available from Sage ERP 1000 V4 SP11 Patch 5 onwards when PO_INSTAL is set to YES.  For earlier versions the suggested way to workaround the issue is to remove the CIS deduction from the invoice and create a separate POP credit note. The  'Override POP invoice header VAT code' field in VAT Code Maintenance uses the existing unused VAT field vtind and is not restricted to only be used for CIS purchase invoices. When the field is ticked in VAT Code Maintenance any purchase lines using this rate will not be overwritten with the VAT rate from the purchase invoice header. To see this working on a test environment do the following: Ensure PO_INSTAL = YES Go to VAT Code Maintenance and enter a new VAT code CSD with a rate of 0%.  Tick the new Override POP invoice header VAT code box.  Press F3 and set the Sales and Purchase EC fields to No.  Save the VAT code. Check your standard Purchase VAT code (PV) is set to a rate 20% and has the new Override box unticked.  Save the VAT code. Create a new VAT code DRC with a rate of 0%.  Do not tick the new Override box and press F3.  Tick the Domestic Reverse Charge box and set the mapped VAT code to your standard VAT code (PV).  S et the Sales and Purchase EC fields to No.  Save. Go to Item VAT Maintenance and add new codes for CSD and DRC. Go to VAT Matrix Maintenance and enter CSD as the VAT type of stock or service and set the VAT code to CSD.  Create a new entry for VAT type PV with VAT code PV and VAT Type DRC with VAT code DRC. Go to Full Stock Details and enter a new product in any warehouse.  Set the VAT type as PV and enter a standard and current cost of 100. Go to POP Service and create a new item CIS_DEDUCTION with a VAT type as CSD and a cost of -10. Go to PL Suppliers and create a new Supplier and leave the VAT code as blank. Go to POP Order Entry and create a new order for your new supplier and your new product ensuring the quantity is 1 and the cost is 100.  Print the order. Go to POP Receipts and receive your PO. Go to POP Invoices and create a new batch for your supplier.  On the invoice header screen set the VAT code to be DRC and confirm.  Enter your order number and invoice your product.  On the next line enter your service code and note the cost is -10.  Esc to the header and press F8 to calculate the VAT.  Enter an invoice amount of 90 and press F6 to authorise.  Esc and press F4 to post the invoice. Go to AP Invoice Audit Trail and enter your supplier in both range fields and run the report.  Note that the product line shows a VAT code of DRC and the line for the service shows a VAT code of CSD.  There may also be 2 zero lines for VAT, one for each VAT code. Go to Making Tax Digital - Tax Return Report (Beta) and enter an effective date of the date you posted the invoice and your supplier in both supplier range fields.  View the report and note that there are lines for the invoice but only for the product, which shows the reverse charge of 20.00. There are no entries for the service as the VAT code was not overridden.",

    "title": "Communication: Reminder: VAT for voluntary filers",
    "info": "Created on 17 March 2021 | Last modified on 24 November 2023",
    "content": "Summary This communication was issued to our Sage Business Partner. Description This communication was sent 17 March 2021. Reminder: VAT for voluntary filers Notice 21-H | 17 March 2021 Dear partner Last year we wrote to you to outline the upcoming changes for VAT submissions for voluntary filers. We wanted to remind you that the deadline is approaching. This change will see changes for users of Sage Business Cloud Accounting, Sage 50 Accounts and Sage 200cloud which contain in-product XML submission capabilities in addition to MTD*. As a Sage Partner, it's essential you're aware of this change and the options available. This will ensure you can support customers & help them manage this change. *In-product MTD submission capability is version specific. What's changing? From 08 April 2021 the HMRC are making changes to how VAT returns are submitted and the option to submit VAT returns electronically using XML format will no longer be possible. Not to worry, Sage have got it covered! In Product Submission To submit VAT Returns electronically using Sage Business Cloud Accounting, Sage 50 or Sage 200 software, customers will need to register for Making Tax Digital (MTD) to submit their next return: If customers pay HMRC by Direct Debit, they must sign up for MTD at least 5 working days after their last non-MTD VAT Return submission. This needs to be at least 7 working days before their first MTD submission. For other payment methods, there must be 24 hours after their last submission and 72 hours before their first MTD submission. Making Tax Digital (MTD) will be the simplest way to submit using existing Sage software and we would strongly recommend this for the long-term success of customers businesses. All customers will be required to register for MTD by 2022. Note: Once successfully registered, customers will be unable to de-register. Are there other options? Yes, customers have the option of manually filing their return after this date on the HMRC Portal. They can either sign in to the government gateway here or create a government gateway account here . Should they decide to appoint an accountant, it is important to speak to them before making any decisions on the VAT submission. What about other products? Other products such as Sage Intacct, Sage X3, Sage 300 and Sage ERP 1000 do not have an in-product XML VAT submission capability and therefore customers will already be using the MTD submissions module. Questions? To prepare for this upcoming change, you can find some useful information on our Making Tax Digital hub or alternatively through our support articles which help provide the information you need to remain compliant. We've included some below. Sage Blog Sage 50 Sage 200cloud Overview of all MTD articles",

    "title": "How does General Consolidation work in Sage ERP 1000 and Line 500?",
    "info": "Created on 08 September 2022 | Last modified on 08 September 2022",
    "content": "Summary This article details how the General Consoiidation module works and the ways in which the year end and the adjustment period should be approached. Resolution General Ledger Consolidation consolidates the General Ledgers from subsidiary companies into the Master company. Setup of Consolidation is not covered here – refer to the Consolidation online help for further details on set up. The consolidation works by taking the current year movements (opening, period and / or adjustment values) from each subsidiary GL nlmastm, and posting these to the Master company such that transactions are created for each subsidiary company / year / period / GL code, and the master files (nlmastm and nlaccm) updated accordingly. Additional transactions may be written for reporting currency imbalances and exchange differences (the subsidiary ledgers may be in a different currency). The cleardown can identify the transactions written for a particular subsidiary and thus these may be deleted and the master files (nlmastm and nlaccm) updated accordingly.  This can be useful if duplications have been accidently posted to the consolidation company for one subsidiary. NOTE 1 - The consolidation cannot be fooled to work for the previous year by setting NLYEAR back 1. This is because it works from nlmastm, not nltranm. NOTE 2 - The consolidation requires exclusive use of most tables in the subsidiary and master companies. In April 2015, an issue was fixed in the Consolidate Companies option whereby the option failed with a HandleAddressList error when one of the tables was in use. NOTE 3 - Manual GL Journals (or any other GL related transactions) should not be posted in the Master company if the Master company is purely a consolidation of the subsidiary companies only. Otherwise this could lead to problems with opening balances. If the Master company is purely a consolidation of the subsidiary companies, then consider the following: GL Year End. Opening balances may be handled in either of the following ways for the Master company: Option 1 - Leave \"Zero balance carried forward\" un-ticked, and do not run Consolidations for periods O-O. Option 2 - Tick the \"Zero balance carried forward\" and run Consolidations for periods O-O when the GL Year End has been run for each subsidiary company. GL Adjustment Period. Opening balances may be handled in either of the following ways for the Master company: Option 1 - Run consolidations for periods A-A immediately before closing the Adjustment period for each subsidiary company, then run the Close Adjustment Period in the Master company when the Close Adjustment Period has been run for each subsidiary company. Option 2 - In the Master company, set system key NLADJOPEN to NO. After running the Close Adjustment Periods in each subsidiary company, re-run the Consolidations for periods O-O. This method should only be used if Option 2 has been taken for the GL Year End. If the opening balances are incorrect in the Master company, and the Master company is purely a consolidation of the subsidiary companies, then these may be reset as follows. We strongly suggest checking with your Sage Customer Support Team if you have this issue.  Please ensure that a backup of your system has been taken before going ahead with the following steps. Delete the period \" 00\" transactions for the current year from the Master company's nltranm. Run nlnewmast and nlnewacc in the Master company, setting Recalculate Opening Balances to Y. Run the consolidations for each of the subsidiary companies for period O-O.",

    "title": "How does the (SOP) Product category discount work with multiple order lines in Sage ERP 1000 and Line 500?",
    "info": "Created on 08 May 2020 | Last modified on 23 March 2022",
    "content": "Summary This guide explains how product catyegory discounts are designed to work with multiple order lines Description Resolution Product category discount may be calculated and applied if system key OPPRODDISC is YES. The full discount type for this is \"Percentage discount per product discount category\". This discount is (optionally) calculated when escape from order line entry to the trailer. If you have 2 product lines that both have the same product category discount, if the total quantity of the two lines qualify for a discount then the list price is discounted for the two products. Example 1: Creat a product - Red Bricks - list price 1.00 (SOP Category = P02 ) Create a product - Brown Bricks - list price of 1.00 (SOP Category = P02 ) Create a Product category discount P02 = for 150 or more for 10% discount (-10.00) Raise a Sales order for 100 red bricks and 100 brown bricks. When you recalculate the product category discount on the order both products will show a discounted price of 90.00. If you then amend the price of the red bricks to 0.80 each, and recalculate the product category discount within the order, the total price for each will be changed to the following: Red Bricks = 100.00 Brown Bricks = 80.00 The amended price of the red bricks remains as 0.80 as this is now a 'special price'. The price of the brown bricks reverts back to the original line price as they are now excluded from the calculation. NB : There was an issue where order lines that were amended after applying product category discounts to multiple lines, the price was reverting to the original discounted price not the new price. Now if the price is changed for one of these lines after the product category discount has been calculated, then the line will be excluded if the product category discount is recalculated. This fix was made in V4 SP8.",

    "info": "Created on 22 June 2021 | Last modified on 06 October 2022",
    "content": "Summary This guide explains some changes HMRC are making to their systems which may affect you if you pay your VAT by Direct Debit. Description What's changing? HMRC are currently undergoing work on the transformation of VAT services which will involve migrating customers to a new IT platform. This impacts customers with an existing Direct Debit. UK banking regulations require HMRC to hold a valid contact point for customers using Direct Debit. This is so they can notify you in advance when the payment will be taken from your account and the amount. This means any customers who wish to continue paying their VAT by Direct Debit will need to supply their (not their agent’s) email address prior to their account being migrated to the new platform. If a customer doesn't supply an email address, HMRC will cancel their Direct Debit and the customer will need to pay their VAT via an alternative method. How does this affect me? If HMRC don't have an email address for you before they move your account to the new system, they will cancel your Direct Debit. HMRC intend to start moving these accounts in July 2021 and hope to finish the work by September 2021. Businesses should have received a letter from HMRC in May advising of this change. What do I need to do? If you want to continue to pay your VAT by Direct Debit, log into your Government Gateway or Business Tax account and enter your email address as soon as possible. If you don't do this in time don't worry, once your account has been moved, when you next log into your Government Gateway or Business Tax account you'll be automatically prompted to set up a new Direct Debit and provide a contact email address.",

    "content": "Summary Deleting BACS submissions can give the error 'deletion not allowed' in Sage ERP1000 and Line 500.  This article explains how this can be resolved. Resolution The maximum number of submissions allowed in BACS is 99. When the system has reached that limit, the older submissions will need to be deleted. Sometimes, when trying to delete past submissions you may see the error 'deletion not allowed'. This occurs because some of the transactions within the submission have not been accepted for whatever reason, i.e. the send indicator will be set to 1, 2 or 3. NB: You can check the status of the submission by checking the database table bcnnnnnnm (where nnnnnn is the submission number). The send_ind column holds the send indicator of the items within the submission. Provided you are happy that the submission can be deleted, you can mark the remaining items as accepted to allow you to delete the submission. In the submission database table, this will actually set the send_ind to 4. To mark the items as accepted: Go to ‘Amend Past Transactions’. Enter the submission serial number and select F6-Mark. Go back to ‘Delete Past Submissions’ and re-enter the submission number. You should now be able to delete the submission successfully.",

    "title": "Communication - Sage 200 licence expiry & TLS update",
    "info": "Created on 15 September 2021 | Last modified on 06 October 2022",
    "content": "Summary This communication was issued to our Sage 200 / 500 / 1000 / X3 and Intacct Partner community. Description Sage 200 licence expiry & TLS update Notice 21-CW | 06 October 2021 Dear Partner / Developer, We are writing to you to let you know that the deadline to upgrade customers using older versions (Sage 2013 up to and include Sage 200 Spring 2019) of the Sage Licence Service is changing. Below you can find all the details you need to know to support customers affected. Overview of the current situation TLS is a security protocol required for a variety of services, including the Sage Licence Service, which enables products to communicate securely. It’s important to note that TLS is not a protocol provided by Sage. Sage 200 2013 up to and including Sage 200 Spring 2019 use a version of the Sage Licence Service which operates using the TLS 1.0 protocol. As this security protocol is now retired, with no future security updates scheduled, it presents a risk to customers if they continue to use it. To remove this risk, we made the decision to retire the use of this variant. What is changing? The deadline date by which all customers need to upgrade to versions of Sage 200 that operate using the new licence service, operating the TLS 1.0 protocol, is now 30 September 2022. Previously the deadline date communicated was 30 September 2023, with staggered dates to support partner implementation capacity. Why is the date changing? We constantly monitor the service for several key elements including availability and risk. Recent monitoring has identified that the potential risk has increased and therefore, it is not appropriate to retain the original deadline date of September 2023. What does this mean for my business & customers? We understand that the change in deadline date will present a challenge to our customers and partners, therefore, to further support you, we will be providing a licence patch for the following versions: 2018.00 (Summer 2018) 2018.01 (Winter 2018) 2018.02 (Spring 2019) This patch will need to be applied to the Sage 200 Server and will require a minimal amount of disruption to the customer. These patches will be available shortly after we have released Sage 200 2022 R1, scheduled for early 2022. Though if it is appropriate, upgrades to the latest version are still an option. We will not be providing patches for earlier versions, in line with the Sage lifecycle policy . Sage 200 Historical Licences Customers who operate a Sage 200 historical licence, where they are also using Sage 200 2013 up to and including Sage 200 Spring 2019 will also need to take action. They can either: Discontinue use of the historical licence by the deadline date of 30 September 2022, if it’s no longer required. Apply the patch we’ll provide if they are using 2018.00, 2018.01, 2018.02. Follow the historical licence upgrade process. You can access the disclaimers using the links: UK Ireland Important Note: To ensure the best experience possible for customers, and to minimise the required upgrades, we’d ask that you also review our announcement regarding Internet Explorer 11, which you can access here . Questions? If your enquiry is of a technical or support nature in the first instance, please contact the relevant support team as usual. Alternatively, with any other queries, please speak to your Partner Account Manager. Kind regards, Jo Kirkup Product Manager, Sage 200 Anita Holley Product Marketing Manager, Sage 200",

    "info": "Created on 25 February 2021 | Last modified on 23 March 2022",
    "content": "Summary This article describes the CIS Reverse Charge VAT legislation functionality released in March 2021 to allow products and services to be processed for orders, invoices and credit notes in Sales Order Processing and Telesales. Description NOTE: T he government delayed the date to which this legislation comes into action from October 2019 to 1st March 2021, more information can be found here . The way in which VAT is charged on construction services will change from 1st March 2021, as a result of new anti-fraud rules. This will impact domestic supplies (UK Only) where payments are reported under the 'Construction Industry Scheme', more specifically supplies of services that are Standard Rate (20%) or Reduced Rate (5%). Resolution The functionality is available from the following versions onwards: Sage ERP 1000 V4 SP11 Patch 3 Hotfix 2 Sage ERP 1000 V3 SP14 Patch 3 Hotfix 2 Line 500 7.1 OP71.227, AT71.126 and SK71.166 The set up for MTD, Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable and Purchase Order Processing is unchanged from the workaround for CIS for all versions. Summary of New Functionality Set new system key OPCISREVCH to YES to enable the new CIS functionality Create new system key(s) OPCISRVxxx (where xxx is your CIS 0 rated VAT code) and set it to 0,zzz (where zzz is the standard Sales VAT code for the rate to be reversed) for every CIS VAT code in use Link your CIS VAT codes to products, services, customers and suppliers through the VAT Matrix if this has not already  been completed Set OPCISREVCR to YES to apply the functionality to credit notes for products and services Set OPCISREVMX to YES to enable a warning message on the order and invoice trailer if a mix of VAT codes are on the order A new field rcvat_msg2 can be added to the invoice tail to specify the VAT code used for CIS on the invoice. If the workaround for CIS was previously in use and DA1407 is enabled only for CIS it should be switched off.  If the system detects invoices which could use either CIS functionality when in Invoice and Credit Print then no invoices will be processed General Limitations The customer (user) must manually check to ensure that all invoice lines in all modules are for CIS Reverse Charge VAT codes or none of them are. Making Tax Digital The changes are identical to the workaround instructions for all versions of Sage ERP 1000 and Line 500. Accounts Payable Only Accounts Payable transactions have any impact on the MTD Tax reports and Tax return The  customer (user) is expected to know which transactions it applies to Setting up a new Purchase CIS Reverse Charge VAT code Go to General Configuration - Create / Amend Master Files - VAT Configuration - VAT Code Create a new VAT code (for example PVC) and enter a description and a VAT rate of 0 Enter valid GL control code and set the Ledger to Accounts Payable Press F2 browse on the VAT service and pick up your VAT service code Press F3 to access the Extra Details for MTD screen Set the Sales EC and Purchase EC fields to No Tick the Domestic reverse charge box.  If you are on MTD version 1.2 or below the box will be titled Purchase reverse charge.   It is the same field and should be ticked. In the Mapped VAT code field press F2 Browse and find and select your existing 20% purchase VAT code (for example PV) Press Confirm twice to create your new code Purchase Ledger Invoices on the MTD Tax Report Invoices using the new VAT code will display three lines on the MTD Tax Report.  An invoice line, a reverse charge line and a payment line. They will update boxes 1, 3, 4 and 7 of the MTD Return Purchase Order Processing The customer (user) must manually check to ensure that all invoice lines are for CIS Reverse Charge VAT codes or none of them are. This is a HMRC limitation Products and Services are supported for Purchase Invoices Once the VAT matrix is set to pick up your CIS VAT code invoicing will proceed as normal Adding the Purchase CIS VAT code to the VAT Matrix The basic steps required are shown below.  Time should be taken at this stage to review which combination of products, services and account types will require the reverse charge for Purchases and Sales and how this impacts the current entries in the VAT Matrix. Go to General Configuration - Create / Amend Master Files - VAT Configuration - Item VAT Type Maintenance Create a new CIS item VAT code (for example CIS) with a description Go to General Configuration - Create / Amend Master Files - VAT Configuration - VAT Matrix Maintenance Create a new entry of CIS for the item type and leave the VAT type of the customer or supplier blank Enter a description and F2 browse and pick up your Purchase CIS VAT code (for example PVC) Adding the Item VAT code to a product Go to Inventory Control - Create / Amend Files - Full Stock Details For each of your products add the new Item VAT code to the VAT type field on Page 1 Adding the Item VAT code to a Service Go to Purchase Order Processing - Create / Amend Files - Services For each of your services add your new Item VAT code to the VAT type field Accounts Receivable If you are entering invoices directly you can use any zero VAT rated code but it is advisable to create a new code for CIS invoices If you are entering invoices through Sales Order Processing or Telesales then you must create a new CIS VAT code and set up the new CIS functionality.  See section below.

    "title": "Multiple heaps",
    "info": "Created on 08 May 2020 | Last modified on 23 March 2022",
    "content": "Summary This document describes how to manipulate the Windows non-interactive heap to acheive a higher concurrent user count for Line 500 and Sage 1000 Fin&Ops. Resolution What is the Windows heap? The range of concurrent users or processes Line 500 / Fin&Ops can support is determined by the non-interactive Windows heap. The default size of this heap is 512Kb, however it may be increased to allow more users or processes to run simultaneously. Calculating the heap size As a rule of thumb, each process or option open in Line 500 or Fin&Ops requires 3.5Kb. When calculating the heap size, it is important not to forget the initial menu process for each user. The formula is: Heap(Kb) = ((Users * Options) + Users) * 3.5 For example, to support 100 users, each with 3 options open, requires a heap of ~1.4Mb Heap = ((100 * 3) + 100) * 3.5 = ~1.4Mb Increasing the heap There are two ways to increase the heap capacity. The preferred method, using Multiple heaps, allows a larger proportion of the non-interactive heap to be allocated to Line 500 / Sage 1000, by using several smaller heaps. Before Multiple heaps, the Windows heap itself would be increased meaning all services requiring a non-interactive heap would be allocated the increased heap resource. So, for example, if the Windows heap was increased from 512Kb to 1Mb, the result would be tens of services being allocated an extra 512Kb, which would be a huge waste of memory. Multiple Heaps within Line 500 / Sage 1000 CSAgent supports a new mode of operation where it creates a user-defined number of desktop heaps, and distributes launched server programs evenly among those heaps. The service is registered to run in multiple heap or 'run-as' mode, where the number of heaps available is defined in the ‘csmaster/server’ table. The extra heaps are of the same size as the Windows non-interactive heap. This is the preferred method of increasing the heap size as it does not involve changing any of the Windows heap settings in the registry and is specific to the Sage application. All heaps are allocated from the overall Windows non-interactive heap quota – it does not allow an infinite amount of heap space. Configuration The steps below assume that ‘csuser’ starts the ‘csagent’ service and ‘scheme’ is the database user for ‘csmaster’. 1.     Create encrypted login password files for ‘csuser’ and ‘scheme’ users: From ‘csserver\\bin\\production’ run ‘CRTXLogin’: C:\\csserver\\bin\\Production>crtxlogin Enter login name to be encrypted: csuser Enter password to be encrypted: password Enter output filename: oslogin Repeat with the user ‘scheme’ and save the file as ‘dblogin’, then copy both files to the ‘csserver\\services’ folder. Use ‘domain\\user’ for domain users. Native Active Directory domain (domains without NT4 domain controllers) should use the format: [email protected] .  Mixed Active Directory domains should use the format: domain\\user. 2.    Update the CSAgent service: Open the Registry key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\CSAgent\\Parameters Change the ‘AppParameters’ entry from: \"DRIVER= SQLServer;SERVER=5-06048;DATABASE=csmas…. to: –x dblogin –y oslogin \"DRIVER= SQLServer;SERVER=5-06048;DATABASE=csmas…. 3.    Select the number of heaps that are required: From Enterprise Manager, open the ‘csmaster/server’ table. Enter the required number of heaps in the ‘num_heaps’ column. The maximum is 300, but of course, this is limited by heap memory. Note that the Windows heap should be set to ‘512’ when using multiple heaps. See ‘Adjusting the Windows Heap’ for more information. The total heap size available to Line 500 / Sage 1000 is calculated by multiplying the number of heaps by the standard Windows non-interactive heap size. 4.     Restart the CSAgent service. Implications The CSAgent service must be started under the ‘Local System’ account. If using shared network resources, ensure a valid network user is used when encrypting the username in step ‘a’. Extended Security is not compatible with ‘run-as’ mode. When running Extended Security each process launched creates its own heap. This is because of the architecture of Windows heap control. Extended Security is likely to increase desktop heap usage and therefore exacerbate the problem. It can also generate the error ‘Cannot run application – user configuration error’. Diagnostics Messages are written to the Windows Event Application log. After changing the parameters and restarting the service, check the Application log to ensure the service has started without problems. If the service was registered with the ‘-y’ command, extra reporting is written to the Application log, including the number of heaps being used. For example: Agent starting in run-as security mode, number of desktop heaps = 2 If the ‘num_heaps’ parameter is left blank, a default of ‘1’ is used. Adjusting the Windows heap The non-interactive Windows heap can be increased rather than using ‘multiple heaps’, but as mentioned, increasing the heap allocates more memory for every service that uses the non-interactive heap which can waste a significant amount of memory. The default non-interactive heap size for a Windows 2003 installation is 512Kb. This can be increased by amending the following Registry key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Session Manager\\SubSystems The third value is the non-interactive heap: %SystemRoot%\\system32\\csrss.exe ObjectDirectory=\\Windows SharedSection=1024,3072,512 From experience, it is found that most sites cannot increase the heap above 2 or 3Mb before the limit is reached. When ‘multiple heaps’ are used, the Windows heap should be set to the default ‘512’.",

This is the default Windows behaviour. If the dllhost process exceeds this memory limit SRD reports will fail with the following error: \"The report being generated is too large for the amount of memory available\" As an alternative to configuring the Pooling and Recycling settings against the COM+ service, you can Enable 3GB Support. This increases the memory limit to 3GB.  If you also set the idle shutdown time to 240 mins then a site is far less likely to hit the memory limit and at the end of the day the process will be shutdown due to inactivity. The next time a report is run the process automatically starts up again.",

Switching columns can be achieved by clicking on the required column. Once the chosen column has been selected, it is possible to search for a particular record using the Keyword search by entering a character or characters of the record required. If an exact match cannot be found, then the next nearest match would be returned. In the above example, there are 3 similar sounding customers: INGLENOOK, INGLETON, INGLEWOOD. A search on the work INGLES will return the record INGLETON, which is the next nearest match to INGLES.  A search on the work INGLE will return the record INGLENOOK, which is the first record with the characters INGLE.",

    "title": "Common Cash Book Questions for Sage ERP 1000 and Line 500",
    "info": "Created on 08 May 2020 | Last modified on 23 March 2022",
    "content": "Summary Below we have a selection of common questions we are asked in support; regarding processing cash management tasks and possible solutions. Resolution How is the Total Statement Balance Calculated? If the CBRECON system key is set to NO so on the bank reconciliation report it is NOT cash management totals but STATEMENT totals that are being reported. \"total statement\" field I want to know what transactions values make this figure up Answer Bank Reconciliation Report The Bank Reconciliation report reconciles the Cash Management items to the bank statement, or vice versa, for all or a selected range of bank accounts. The mode of reconciliation is determined by the system key CBRECON, which must be set to one of the following values when Cash Management is installed: YES The Cash Management transactions are reconciled to the statement items. NO The statement items are reconciled to the Cash Management transactions. When Cash Management is reconciled with the statements, the Bank Reconciliation report is produced in the following order: Cash Management balance. Unpresented and uncleared Cash Management transactions, and their total. Unmatched statement items and their total Statement balance. Any difference between the two balances. When the statements are reconciled with Cash Management, the Bank Reconciliation report is produced in the following order: Statement balance. Unpresented and uncleared Cash Management transactions, and their total. Unmatched statement items and their total Cash Management balance. Any variance between the two balances. In either mode of reconciliation, a summary report may be produced, showing just the totals of unpresented cheques and unmatched statement items. You can also choose to include the future transactions if CBNEXTPOST is set to YES There is a variance on the bank reconciliation and they want to run month end. Where does the system pick up the \"Total Statement\"figure from? Is it held in a table somewhere or is it a total? Answer The file cbbankm has a field in it called last_stat_total. You will get a variance if future cash items have been posted and these should be cleared out once the period end has been run. The Total Statement Balance is made up from the Total Cash Management = current period transactions only Cash Man Balance = total balance (including future transactions) Statements import routine hasn't imported any transactions and no error is given Importing statements. Template has been setup and the option appears to work (Statement import complete; No of errors = 0) but no transactions are imported (No of transactions = 0; Transaction Value = 0.00) Answer On the statement format, you have specified the account number as one of the fields, when you try and do the import, the account number on the import file is compared against the account number on the bank account master file, if these are not the same, the import wont work. There are also two other potential causes, the date format on the CSV file is DD/MM/YY but you have set the date format on the template as DD/MM/YYYY, this will therefore fail validation. Final issue is that debit and credit are both record position 9 and the program thinks there are two values and will fail. You will need to blank one out or move the debit or credits to different positions in the CSV file, so that they're seperated. Some transaction appear in Bank statement but do not appear in Cash Management Some transactions appear in Bank Statement but do not appear in cash management. AR period end has been run but CM module is still open. The few transactions were keyed into CM statements so that the bank reconciliation will balance for period end. However before the CM period could be run receipts were keyed into the AR module and posted to through to cash management. p> This resulted in future transactions being created in cash management. The few transactions were outstanding in the bank reconciliation and cannot be removed. Answer Using CBDATFIX change transaction period to be current period.

    "title": "What is VAT Clawback",
    "info": "Created on 08 May 2020 | Last modified on 23 March 2022",
    "content": "Summary This is a guide to help explain what VAT Clawback is and includes examples to show how it works in Sage ERP 1000 and Line 500. Description VAT clawback is a correction of posted VAT amounts in the case that settlement discount is used when paying an invoice. The VAT clawback is, mainly if not only, used in Germany. The philosophy behind it is, that fiscal authorities only allow a reduction of VAT if settlement discount is really taken when paying an open item. If settlement discount is allowed for a supplier or customer but it is not taken, then no reduction of the VAT can be claimed back. Resolution Simplified example of VAT Clawback: A sales invoice has been posted with 16% VAT Account Debit Credit Sales Ledger Control Account 116.00 Goods Account 100.00 VAT Account 16.00 The customer in entitled to 2% settlement discount calculated over the gross amount of the invoice, i.e. 2.32. F Note: The invoice needs to be posted without taking into account any settlement discount. The above invoice is now paid using the 2% settlement discount with the following posting: Account Debit Credit Bank account 113.68 Settlement Discount Account 2.00 VAT (clawback) Account 0.32 Sales Ledger Control Account 116.00 If the invoice is paid without using the allowed settlement discount the posting has to be: Account Debit Credit Bank 116.00 Sales Ledger Control Account 116.00 Relevant system keys: CESETTDISC YES OPCLAWVAT YES OPSETTCALC GROSS OPVATCALC YES PLNLCLAW Purchase Ledger VAT Clawback Account (default) POCLAWVAT YES POSETTCALC GROSS SLNLCLAW Sales Ledger VAT Clawback Account (default) The VAT Clawback accounts: Within VAT code maintenance a VAT Clawback account can or has to entered for everyVAT code. If different VAT percentages are in use it is highly recommended to have a different VAT account per percentage. The clawback account does not have to be different to the corresponding VAT account. Note: If every VAT code is using the same VAT Clawback account the clawback amount is posted as a total to this account, even if the paid invoice(s) had different VAT percentages. Simplified examples of VAT codes using the same Clawback account: An invoice has been posted for goods with a value of 100 at 16% and 7% VAT Account Debit Credit Sales Ledger Control Account 223.00 Goods Account 100.00 VAT Account 16% 16.00 Goods account 100.00 VAT Account 7% 7.00 If this invoice is paid using 2% settlement discount but with a single VAT clawback account being used, the posting will be as follows: Account Debit Credit Bank account 218.54 Settlement Discount Account 4.00 VAT (clawback) Account 0.46 Sales Ledger Control Account 223.00 If this invoice is paid using 2% settlement discount where different VAT clawback accounts are in use, the posting will be as follows: Account Debit Credit Bank account 218.54 Settlement Discount Account 4.00 VAT (clawback) Account 16% 0.32 VAT (clawback) Account 7% 0.14 Sales Ledger Control Account 223.00 Both examples show that the clawback amount is calculated correctly. However from an accounting point of view, the second example is the correct way of posting the VAT clawback. Although the second example reflects the correct posting, it would be advisable to have the ability to have separate settlement discount accounts as well. This would make matching of postings or accounts easier. This will be addressed as part of the Enhancement process. Even though the examples in this document are based on sales ledger postings the same principles also apply to the purchase ledger postings. chicago Upgrading your licence Need a little more room?

    "title": "AP Registered Invoices in a nutshell",
    "info": "Created on 25 November 2024 | Last modified on 25 November 2024",
    "content": "Summary This is a summary of how the AP Registered Invoice functionality works in Sage 1000 Resolution Registered Invoices are entered through the option Invoice Registration. The GL codes may be left blank, in which case the GL code in system key PLGOODSUSP is used to post to the GL. When any of the GL codes are blank or the value in PLGOODSUSP, the invoice may only be !Phase 1 Posted. A phase 1 posted invoice will show in the Transaction Enquiry as type REG. Once phase 1 posted, the GL codes on the invoice may be amended in option !Code & Post Registered Invoices. GL lines may also be added or deleted, and other GL line data may be changed, as long as the overall value is not changed. The only information on the invoice header that may be changed is the effective date. A phase 1 posted invoice may be changed and posted a number of times, although there is a (generous) limit. When none of the GL codes are the value in PLGOODSUSP, the invoice may be !Phase 2 Posted. This is either by the option !Invoice Registration for a new registered invoice or !Code & Post Registered Invoices for a phase 1 posted invoice. A phase 2 posted invoice will show in the Transaction Enquiry as type INV and is treated as a normal invoice. A phase 1 posted invoice may be deleted in the option !Invoices by calling up the batch and deleting the invoice. The GL postings from the previous entries are reversed out. The system key PLDELPHAS1 dictates whether the invoice is actually deleted or marked as deleted. If marked as deleted, the invoice will appear in the invoice audit trail with reversal postings and will be deleted at period end. The case for deleting it immediately is that the invoice number can be re-used. When a phase 1 posted invoice is posted a subsequent time, the GL postings from the previous entry are reversed out and the GL postings from the current entry are made. These postings are made to the period as defined by the !current effective date. AP Invoice Audit Trail Entries The invoice may appear twice in the invoice audit trail with reversal and current postings. Reversals are shown on the invoice audit trail when an invoice has been phase 1 or phase 2 posted in a different period to the period originally posted !in. A reversal will show with an entry for the new postings so that the nett balance for the invoice is zero. Exception is where an invoice is deleted in a subsequent period to the original posting and PLDELPHAS1 is YES, in which case only the reversal is shown. Entries shown on the invoice audit will depend on the period and year range entered. If this range is not entered, only invoices and reversals posted !in the current period will be shown. If this range is entered, entries will be shown for invoices originally or last posted !to a period/year within the range, with reversals as relevant. Note AP Audit Trails. AP Registered Invoice History The history for registered invoices is kept in file plreghstm (and extensions). The entries contain copies of the invoice records for each Code and Post, and these are used to reverse out any previous GL postings. The record structure is identical to that for plinvm. The difference is that the \"/\" in field page_no in plinvm is replaced by a sequential number in plreghstm, so 0 is the initial posting, 1 for the next etc. The history is normally cleared down at period end for invoices that are removed at period end or where the invoice no longer exists. The invoice history may be kept however by setting system keys PLHISTKEEP and PLHISTDAYS. AP Registered Invoice Status (from Code & Post option) As follows:",

    "title": "SPOOLOPN: spool queue “tetra” is full",
    "info": "Created on 21 February 2022 | Last modified on 23 March 2022",
    "content": "Summary This article details the cause and possible workarounds for the error message \"SPOOLOPN: spool queue “tetra” is full\" Resolution SPOOLOPN: spool queue “tetra” is full This message is displayed when an application cannot add a new Spool Job to the Sage Spool Queue because there are no available Job-numbers for the Sage User who gets the message – it does not mean the Hard Disk is full, or that other Users cannot add Spool Jobs. Sage applications submit Spool Jobs to the Sage Spool Queue, and these are then automatically submitted to the relevant Printer, or Deferred for later submission or viewing through Spooler Management or Print Spooled Reports options. Each Job is given a unique name which is based on the User’s name plus a 3-digit Job Number ranging from 000 to 999. If the last Job’s number for the User is 999, the Sage Spooler will try to “wrap round” and start again from 000 – if the Spooler cannot find a number which doesn’t have a Spool Job associated with it, then it will display the “spool queue full” message. There are 3 possible solutions: 1) Delete Spool Jobs If certain Users are experiencing this problem, then they should delete their oldest Spool Jobs to free-up “slots” for future Spool Jobs. This is only a short-term fix, as the User will probably “fill the gaps” quite quickly unless a lot of old Jobs are deleted. 2) Create Spool Queues On a Typical Installation, all Companies share the same Spool Queue (typically “tetra”), so a particular User could get this problem by having 600 Jobs in Company 1 and 399 Jobs in Company 2. If this sort of situation is likely to occur, the System Manager could look at setting up a Spool Queue for each Company so that *all* users could have 999 Jobs in each Company: Note that the existing Jobs  will remain – just type in the original Queue name. 3) Create new Spool Queues for each Year The same as (2), but all Companies could share the same Spool Queue for each Calendar/Financial Year – e.g. set SPOOLQ to tetra09 for 2009/2010 and then tetra10 for 2010/2011.",

    "title": "New system key: OPINVRTDPS - Number of decimal places printed for the VAT rate on a Sales Invoice",
    "info": "Created on 09 November 2022 | Last modified on 06 January 2023",
    "content": "Summary It is possible to amend the number of decimal places for VAT rates in Layout Manager but this does not change the decimal places shown on a Sales Invoice.  OPINVRTDPS has been introduced to resolve this issue. Resolution The new system key OPINVRTDPS is only available in Sage ERP 1000 V4 SP11 Patch 7 The number of decimal places for VAT codes can be amended in the nvat_file_maint/details form of your user formset in Layout Manager.  The system defaults this to 3 in the Field Type Information section.  However, when printing the Sales Invoice, the VAT rate only prints to 3 decimal places, this was previously hardcoded. OPINVRTDPS can be set to match the number of decimal places of the VAT rate.  The default value is 3 to match the default on the VAT rate. The fix is restricted to SOP, and only on the invoice print. To see this working on a test system do the following: 1. Open Layout Manager and copy the ce,nvat_file_maint forms to your user formset 2. Open the nvat_file_maint/details form in your user formset 3. Click on the VAT rate section so it is highlighted in green 4. In the bottom left of the screen click on DataComponents and then click on the elipsis to bring up the Data Component Collection Editor box 5. In the vatr_rate_properties box click on the + of the FieldTypeInformation to expand it 6. Highlight the NumbeofDecimalPlaces line and change the value from 3 to 4 7. Press OK and Save the form changes 8. Go to General Config – Create/Amend – VAT Codes – Create a new VAT rate CAL and set the rate to be 5.1234. 9.  Add CAL to Account type VAT and in the VAT matrix add an entry for blank stock and customer CAL for VAT code CAL 10. Create a new customer LAD with An account VAT type of CAL 11.  Create a new Sales Invoice, noting the invoice number, for LAD for 1x W1 461-210 and note that the VAT code is CAL and it dsplays on the detail line as 5.123.  Print the invoice and note the VAT rate on the trailer in the trailer displays as 5.123 12. System Keys. Call up OPINVRTDPS. Check – defaults to 3 and the help makes sense. Set it to 4. 13. SOP Sales Invoices. Recall the invoice noted in step 11 and Reprint. View the spool file. Check – the VAT rate in the trailer is 5.1234. 14. Open Layout Manager and copy form op, spool_invoices, print_form3 to your user formset 15. Open this form in your user formset, and add field vatpc (suspended in standard) to subform line_details, perhaps with a suitable prompt. 16. Log off/on to refresh. 17. SOP Sales Invoices. Recall the invoice noted in step 11 and Reprint. View the spool file. Check – the VAT rate is 5.1234 on the detail line.",

If there is a statement customer, the credit limit of the statement customer is checked to determine whether the order/invoice will be credit stopped or not. If there is no statement customer but there is an invoice customer, then the credit limit from the invoice customer will be used instead. If you have both a statement and invoice customer, the statement customer credit limit will take precedence. In addition if system key OPOUTORD is also set to YES, the Accounts Receivable balance from the statement (or invoice) customer is checked then adds the outstanding order balance from the statement (or invoice) customer.

    "content": "Summary This article details how to access Internet Options if Internet Explorer is no longer available. Resolution Within the Product Installation guides, references are made to configuring Internet Options when installing and configuring the Sage ERP 1000 product. When Internet Explorer is no longer available on the installation machine, then the following steps can be used to access the necessary settings within Windows. As mentioned above, there are connectivity settings that still need to be set during installation, e.g. security settings. Historically, these settings have been available via the options dialog within Internet Explorer. This can be accessed via the Network and Sharing Centre in Windows. Please note that Internet Explorer is no longer required to run the Sage ERP 1000 Java Client. This assumes installations are for Sage ERP 1000 V3 SP13 or greater and Sage ERP 1000 V4 SP10 or greater. To access the settings: 1. Click on the Windows Start icon 2. Select Settings icon (gear) 3. Select “Network & Internet”. 4. Select “Status” from the menu in the left-hand panel. 5. Click on the link for “Network and Sharing Centre”. 6. Under the heading “See also”, click the link for “Internet Options”. 7. The familiar Internet Properties dialog will open. Refer to the Sage ERP 1000 installation guides to apply the required settings.",

    "info": "Created on 22 April 2022 | Last modified on 27 April 2022",

The journal posting is OK but the issue will stop the Adjustment Period and General Ledger Year End from completing. Cause Resolution Every element in the posting code hierarchy should be created with a type.  This field specifies whether it is a Profit & Loss (P) account, a Balance Sheet (B) account or is a Cost Centre (C). To ensure the adjustment period and the year end routines calculate correctly every posting code element is checked to ensure it has a valid value. There is a known issue in Journal Entry which creates the cost centre element without the type of C. Data corruption and the incorrect importing of data can also cause the type to be left blank for any element of the posting code. To recreate the known issue on a test area: System Manager - All System Keys - Set NLAUTO = YES and ensure NLCCSTR has at least one element General Ledger - Cost Centres - Create a new cost centre for all of its elements and ensure the Allow automatic creation of Posting codes box is ticked General Ledger - Journal Entry - Create a new standard journal for the current period Add a line for 100 for an existing posting code Add a second line for -100 for a new posting code which is a combination of your new cost centre plus an existing account code Post the journal General Ledger - Enquiries - Full Account - Enter your cost centre and press F2 browse.  Note that the new posting code was created with a type but that the cost centre element before it has no type There is no way in the system to resolve the issue once it has occurred.  To correct the data your Sage ERP 1000 support team must add the missing type to the field kind in the nlmastm table",

This is a unique, sequential number. The last used number is stored in a file called \".seqno\" in the master directory. For Sales Order Tracking, if system key CEAUSEQNO is set to SEQNO (default), the sequence number is taken from the same file. Otherwise, the sequence number is taken from this system key. Resolution The error occurs when the number held in the seqno file exists in the ceauevem table. Usually this message appears when unloading data from one environment to another, and the \".seqno\" file does not get copied over from the master directory. To resolve the issue amend the number in the seqno file to one that is greater than the highest in ceauevem. .",

    "content": "Summary This communication was issued to our Sage Line 500 & Sage 1000 partner community. Description This communication was sent 14 December 2021. Sage Line 500 & Sage 1000: Microsoft Internet Explorer Retirement Information Notice 21-DM | 14 December 2021 Dear Partner, Technology continues to change at pace, that includes how Sage software works alongside associated software including operating systems and web browsers. To this end, we wanted to ensure that you are fully aware of the Microsoft announcement , dated 25 August 2021, which states that from 15 June 2022, Internet Explorer 11 (IE11) will no longer be supported. What does this mean for my business & customers? The Microsoft announcement signifies that Microsoft will no longer provide updates, including those of a security nature. We wanted to share with you the impacts for Sage Line 500 and Sage ERP 1000. Please note that where you have integration with Sage CRM, this too is impacted by the Internet Explorer retirement, you can see more about the impacts on the communication we’ve shared previously. How are the products impacted? Sage Line 500 No immediate action is required where IE11 continues to operate in the environment in which Sage Line 500 is being used. However, customers should be aware that by using software that is no longer supported or running software on an unsupported platform, they will introduce risk to their business. Action is required for customers who pro-actively plan to remove IE11 from their environment. In these circumstances the Line 500 GUI client application, rather than the browser should be used. Sage 1000 v2.x (v2.0/2.1, v2.2, v2.3) No immediate action is required where IE11 continues to be present on the client PCs where Sage 1000 v2.x is being used. (Note that this version of Sage 1000 introduced integration with Sage CRM and its integration functionality remains wholly dependent on Internet Explorer to function). However, customers should be aware that by using software that is no longer supported or running software on an unsupported platform, they will introduce risk to their business. Action is required for customers who pro-actively plan to remove IE11 from their environment. In these circumstances the application will become inoperable. Note that Sage ERP 1000 v4.0 provides integration capability with the latest Sage CRM releases. Sage ERP 1000 (v3.0/v4.0) No immediate action is required where IE11 continues to be present on the client PCs where Sage ERP 1000 is being used. However, customers should be aware that by using software that is no longer supported or running software on an unsupported platform, they will introduce risk to their business. Customers using the latest service packs: For those customers with the latest updates applied, no remedial action is required. The new Java client deployment removes the dependency on Internet Explorer for its operation. Please review our recent patch documentation for advice on configuration settings that were previously applied through Internet Explorer options. (For Sage ERP 1000 v3.0, this applies to SP13 & SP14. For Sage ERP 1000 v4.0, this applies to SP10 & SP11) Customers on prior service packs: Action is required for customers who pro-actively plan to remove IE11 from their environment. In these circumstances the product client will become inoperable and customers should look to upgrade to the latest service pack release. Customers may wish to review channels such as Windows 10 Long Term Servicing Channel (LTSC) to see if this may assist. You will need to be aware of our platform compatibility. Finally, we are reviewing the impact to additional functionality e.g. Report Designer and will share our findings once we have concluded our investigations. Got a question? If your enquiry is of a technical or support nature, please contact the relevant support team in the first instance. Alternatively, please speak to your Partner Account Manager.",

    "info": "Created on 14 June 2021 | Last modified on 06 October 2022",
    "content": "Summary This communication was issued to our Partner community. Description This communication was sent on the 14 June 2021. Upcoming Legislation Changes: EU VAT e-commerce package Notice 21-CD | 14 June 2021 Dear Partner, From 01 July 2021, the EU will introduce new optional VAT schemes for sales to EU consumers (customers in the EU who are not VAT registered). The One Stop Shop The Import One Stop Shop These new schemes allow businesses to report and pay all EU VAT through a single return instead of having to register and pay VAT in each country they sell to. As a Sage Partner, it’s essential you’re aware of these changes and have all of the information you need to hand, ensuring you can support customers and help them manage through these changes. For example, if a UK business sells goods to a customer in France, VAT is charged at the rate applicable in France. As a Sage Partner, it’s essential you’re aware of these changes and have all of the information you need to hand, ensuring you can support customers and help them manage through these changes. The One Stop Shop (OSS) The OSS can be used to report and pay EU VAT on services to EU consumers which attract destination VAT. The OSS can also be used to report and pay EU VAT in relation to intra-community distance sales of goods which are still relevant for businesses residing in Northern Ireland with an XI VAT registration. From 1 July the EU will also abolish distance selling thresholds and replace them with a single EU wide €10,000 (£8,818) threshold. The Import One Stop Shop (IOSS) The IOSS can be used to report and pay EU VAT on goods imported into the EU from outside of the EU – that are destined for EU consumers, and have a consignment value of £135 (€150) or less. When using IOSS destination VAT must be charged at point of sale. This means there is no import VAT upon arrival in the EU, making it easier for the end consumer. How will customers register? It is important to note that the new One Stop Shop schemes are optional. Customers in the UK wishing to register can do this in either an EU member state or potentially in the UK depending on their location and the scheme they want to use. Customers in Republic of Ireland can register for the OSS in an EU member state, usually their own. Once registered they can report all relevant EU VAT through a single return and make a single payment to the member state you register with. You can learn more on the schemes via the European Commission guidance and UK Government guidance on VAT E-Commerce package. What do I need to know? To prepare for these upcoming changes, you can find useful information in our compliance help centre . This gives you an overview of the changes and our per product approach.",

    "info": "Created on 08 May 2020 | Last modified on 23 March 2022",
    "content": "Summary The following article details how to change the CSAgent services password. Resolution In Sage ERP 1000 the CSAgent service runs with the Local System account, but the parameter \"-y c:\\csserver\\Services\\encpassword“ supplied to the CSAgent service in the registry (HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\services\\csagent\\Parameters) means that it looks for the user credentials in the specified encrypted file. If you change the password of the user contained in this file then it will need regenerating so that the CSAgent services starts correctly. Here is the process for regenerating the encrypted login file for 'csuser' or the user associated with CSAgent: 1. Make a copy of the existing C:\\csserver\\Services\\encpassword file. 2. Run DOS Command Prompt 3. cd C:\\csserver            (or equivalent directory) 4. csmaster.bat 5. cd C:\\csserver\\Sevices 6. crtxlogin Enter login name to be encrypted: >csuser  (or equivalent user) Enter password to be encrypted: >password Enter output filename: >encpassword 7.

    "info": "Created on 16 November 2021 | Last modified on 23 March 2022",
    "content": "Summary The VAT tables can have many years of data.  A  VAT register cleardown option has been introduced to allow old entries to be archived or removed based on a cut off date set in CEVRCDMIN Resolution The VAT Cleardown option is available in Sage ERP 1000 V4 from SP11 Patch 5 onwards.  It will not be introduced for Sage ERP 1000 V3 or Line 500. As this is only available in Sage ERP 1000 V4 where DA0370 is mandatory it impacts the following tables: cevatrgm cevatrgem cevatrgim cevatregmtdm The new option appears in the General Configuration - Housekeeping menu and will allow archive (including removal), or removal of records based on a cut- off date. As the data is VAT related, the cut-off date will be validated to fall on or before (the system date – the number of years specified by system key CEVRCDMIN).  The default of 6 is taken from the HMRC web site, (although should be set to 10 if you are using MOSS). If you choose to archive then an archive table suffix must be entered, it will be added to the master table names to create the archives. E.g., if suffix is 19 then the archive tables will be called: cevatrg19m cevatrge19m cevatrgi19m cevatregmtd19m (pseudo extension) Multiple warnings are shown throughout the process to warn the user that sufficient data must be kept for MTD, VAT Clawback, Pending or Contra VAT registers and HMRC. A final confirmation screen is then presented where the user must type the word CONFIRM to start the cleardown.",

    "content": "Summary Why are my cost of sales postings going to the default account instead of those set up on the Cost of Sales Matrix in Sage ERP 1000 and Line 500? Resolution Sometimes, you have set the cost of sales accounts up in what is believed to be the correct way, but postings are not going to the Cost of Sales accounts set up on the Cost of Sales Matrix in SOP, but rather posting to the default OPNLGDS/OPNLSALES accounts. There is a misconception that the Stock G/L Category code on the Cost of Sales Matrix needs to be set on the Stock G/L Category code field within the Product record. This is only the case if transactions are posted from within Inventory control. If you want to post transactions from within SOP, you must apply the Stock G/L Category code from the Cost of Sales Matrix into the Sales G/L Category field within the Product record. In addition, the Sales G/L Category code on the Cost of Sales Matrix must be applied to the Sales G/L Category field within the Customer record. Another consideration would be that the Sales Customer record has an Invoice customer assigned to it. If you place the Sales G/L Category code to the Sales Customer, and post an invoice in SOP, the Invoice customer will be used. In  this instance, you should apply the Sales G/L category code to the Invoice customer record instead. To recap, set the fields on the records below as follows: Cost of Sales Matrix Customer Record Stock Record Sales G/L Category code Sales G/L Category code Sales G/L Category  code- for SOP transactions Stock G/L Category code Stock G/L Category code - for ST transactions",

If you want the Sage ERP 1000 client session to remain open and for Autoq to use the same session for each routine, then first of all you need to configure 'KeepAlive' in the registry as detailed below: - Set KeepAlive to 'y' - Set Port to an unused port number and save it as a decimal value. Setting the above will mean that the client will no longer close when a routine has completed. To be able to use the same menu session for running the routines, the setting ‘Use menu’ under Tools -> Options should be ticked within the Autoq application.",

The field will vary for each report, but it will be the first field that the Report Designer encounters on the report. There are two steps that you will need to follow: Within the Sage Report Designer go to Tools > Data Sources. Select the ‘Sage 1000 Data Provider’ and then click on the ‘Configure’ button. Amend the server name within the connection string. The above step updates a data source file in the following location on the server: C:\\Users\\ username \\AppData\\Local\\Sage\\Central\\Sage.Query.Engine.DataSources.v4 (Where ‘username’ is the Windows user that made the change). However, when running the Sage Report Designer within the context of Sage ERP 1000, it uses a different data source file. See below.

The system key help advises consultation with your reseller.  This article details how this system key works. Resolution The system key BMLOTFMT has no default value.  When a works order is completed the lot number for the finished goods default to the first six digits of the works order number followed by a / and a sequencial component number starting at 001.  This updates on every completion to the works order So the first item manufactured for the works order for works order 000169 has a lot number of If you have more than six digits for your works order then you may wish to amend the system key BMLOTFMT. Changing the system key This should always be carried out in a test system first to ensure that new lot numbers are created as expected before changing your live system. The system key needs to be set in a specific way.  To set it so that it records an eight digit works order number and then has a one digit sequential number you would set the system key to %-8.8s/1.1d The % means the lot number will be a string The - means it will be left justified The first number is the total number of characters of the works order number The number followed by the s is the number of characters of the works order number to be used and you would expect the two to be the same The numbers followed by the d after the forward slash are for the sequencial component number and you would expect them to be the same Things to be aware of The forward slash is optional.  If you remove it the seqential number that follows will be added with no space.  In our example you would set the system key to %-8.8s1.1d The numbers after the forward slash are also optional.  This means you can have just the works order number as the lot number. This wil create duplicate lot numbers but they are supported in the system The lot number field length is ten characters.  If you set this key to try to produce a lot number bigger than this it will not error, it will just use the first ten characters using the format you have specified. If you set the works order number section to be more characters than a works order itself it will add spaces to the lot number.  For example if you had six digit order number but set BMLOTFMT to %-8.8s/1.1d the lot number would become 000169  /1",

Description Businesses in the EU and Northern Ireland with exports above the dispatch threshold must include the Partner VAT ID and Country of Origin (CoO) in their dispatch Intrastat reports from 1 January 2022. Read more > To do this, you can amend your dispatch report csv file once you generate it from Sage ERP 1000 or Line 500. Resolution Generate your dispatch Intrastat file As there are no changes to the Intrastat process within Sage ERP 1000 and Line 500, your first step is to generate your dispatch Intrastat report csv file.  This needs to be done from the UK Intrastat CSV option. Please note the UK Intrastat EDI option is now redundant and should not be used. When opened in a text editor like Notepad your csv file has a header line for the trader details and the information for the detail lines are listed below it. You should amend these areas by following the section below. Amend the dispatch Intrastat csv file The header line is not used so it should be deleted. For each detail line the VAT number of the partner operator (customer), a not VAT registered inidiacator and the country of origin must be included.  These should be comma separated and added to the end of each line The VAT number is a combination of the vatstate and the ecvatreg fields in the slcustem table.  The customer code for the line is held on the field clientcode in the isstatum table The not VAT registered indicator should be blank if the partner operator is VAT registered, otherwise set to ‘true’. The country of origin is held on the country_orig field in the isstatum table.  This must be XI if the goods were made in Northern Ireland. Once you have obtained the required data, add it to the file and check that it is comma separated and in the correct position. Repeat for each detail line in the file.

    "title": "Considerations when amending the VAT Rate in Sage ERP 1000 and Line 500",
    "info": "Created on 08 May 2020 | Last modified on 23 March 2022",
    "content": "Summary What do I need to consider when changing the VAT /Tax rate in Sage ERP 1000 and Line 500? Resolution Changes to the VAT rate The following information offers guidance on how to change your Sage 1000 / Line 500 systems to cater for changes and considerations when amending VAT rates. Sales Orders At the appropriate time, you should amend the standard sales VAT rate in the VAT Codes option (shown below) to the new rate. The default vat code is held in the system key OPVATCODE but you should also consider any other sales vat codes that may have been set-up in the VAT Matrix. All orders invoiced will then calculate VAT using the new rate without any further adjustment. There could however be exceptions, for example you may need to issue credit notes or issue late invoices that need VAT to be charged at the old rate. To cater for this, you should create a new VAT code and set the rate for this to be the old rate. Any such orders or credit notes will need to be manually amended to enter this new VAT code on the product and service lines. In the case of orders this will need to be done through the option Sales Invoices. To be able to amend the VAT code you need to set the system key OPVATAMEND to YES. There is also a system key named OPVATRATE, although this is described as unused some older applications and bespoke may still reference this, it would be prudent to change the VAT rate held in this key to the new rate. Changing the VAT Rate Go to General Configuration - VAT Configuration -  VAT Codes to amend and create new VAT codes. Sales Order Header Discounts With regard to Order Header discounts if OPORDDISC is YES, you need to consider the system key OPSPLITVAT if your orders will have lines of multiple VAT rates. This functionality has been modified in the past so we advise that you check the binaries relevant to the Line 500/Sage 1000 version/platform before applying the changes. Specifically OP, PO, SL, PL and CE.  If any of these binaries have a date of 2014 or older then we strongly advise these to be updated to the latest binaries. In addition, if OPSPLITVAT is set to NO, and DA0263 is not licensed also consider the setting for the system keys below. System Key Value Description OPDISCNEW New VAT Rate OPDISCVOLD Old VAT Rate OPDISCVDAT Date VAT rate changed OPDISCVDIF YES/NO Allows selection of another VAT code for header discount (OPVATAMEND must be YES and DA0263 not licensed) These system keys only need setting up once. The first 3 system keys above were used with orders on older binaries. Once the later binaries are is in place, the order header discount rate is stored on the order header table in a spare field. Note: If OPDISCVDIF is YES, a new extension table is used. This is ddf entry sop_order_heade_vt, table opheadvtm; it is created by running Create New Project Files for project OP. Purchasing For Purchasing you need to carry out the same changes to VAT codes as for Sales. You should amend the default Purchase VAT code and any additional codes you have created through the VAT Matrix. You will also need to set POVATCHECK to YES to allow you to recalculate the VAT at the time of entering the Invoice. For some businesses, it may be more efficient to delay the changes on the Purchasing side as initially the majority of invoices to process will still be attracting VAT at the old rate. This will be a choice for each business. MTD If the VAT code being changed is used when calculating Reverse Charge VAT or EC VAT for Accounts Payable transactions then please refer to Section 10.4 of the latest MTD guide titled \"System Key family CEVATH\". If the VAT rate changes mid tax period then two new system keys will need to be created as the VAT for these types of transactions is calculated when the reports are run.  Full details on how to set them up are contained in the MTD guide. Note: This functionality is available from MTD Release 1.1 onwards. Contract Management Please note there is no facilitiy to make manual changes to VAT codes, therefore once the VAT rate has been changed to the new rate, all invoices and credits will pick up this rate. Please contact Support if you require further details relating to Contract Management with regards to VAT. Third Party Applications The above detail only covers the core Sage product. If you have any third party applications you should contact their provider to clarify if there are any requirements for change. Prompt Payment Discounts Considerations need to be made around Prompt Payment discounts if your system is setup to use Settlement Discounts on sales or purchase invoices if they are paid early. Refer to the Legal and Fiscal rules for each country around how VAT can be claimed back if Settlement Discount is taken. Contact Support for further details.

    "info": "Created on 11 December 2020 | Last modified on 23 March 2022",
    "content": "Summary This article explains how NI businesses can use Postponed Accounting in Sage ERP 1000 and Line 500 after the Brexit transistion period ends on 31st Decemeber 2020 Description Postponed VAT Accounting will be optional, arranged between the business and the HMRC. If used it will apply to imports to: NI businesses from non-EU states (except GB) NI businesses from non-EU states ( except GB ) NI businesses from non-EU states ( except GB ) For Sage ERP 1000 and Line 500 only the MTD functionality is explicitly affected. Resolution Postponed VAT Accounting (NI) If Postponed VAT Accounting is used, then VAT is not paid at the border and must be included on the Tax Return in Boxes 1 and 4. This should be the monthly figure supplied by the HMRC. Postponed VAT Accounting may be used for imports from non-EU states, except GB. VAT Codes VAT codes currently used for EC Purchases should remain as they are. Monthly HMRC figure(s) The monthly figure(s) supplied by the HMRC must be included in Boxes 1 and 4 on the Tax Return. It is suggested that a GL journal be added and posted each month to achieve this. If required to provide estimated VAT figures before the actual figures are known, then a GL journal(s) with the estimated figures may be added and posted; and a GL journal with the adjustment figures posted once the actual figures are known. Postponed VAT Accounting GL Journal Assuming system key NLVATLINES is YES, and VAT of 20.00 to be recorded: Note a standard Sales VAT code and a standard Purchase VAT code Raise a GL journal with an effective date and period in the correct (reporting) period Add a line for the VAT to be reclaimed. Amount = -20, VAT code = Sales VAT code and the VAT flag set to V Add a second line to offset this.  Amount = 20, VAT code = Purchase VAT code and the VAT flag set to V Post The 20.00 will appear under Sales VAT (Box 1) and Purchase VAT (Box 4) in the MTD GL detailed report If system key NLVATLINES is NO, then it is possible to enter a GL journal as above (but there is not the option to enter a Goods / VAT flag), the rate for the VAT code used should be large, e.g. 99,999,999. This type of VAT code may be used for VAT only invoices. The journal must be posted to the relevant period. If it is not normally possible to post ahead, then consider setting the NLPERSxxxx system keys to post to future periods for specific users, or setting the Start date on the MTD Tax Entity to pick up transactions from previous periods that have not already been picked up. CAUTION: GL Journal / VAT Register Issue There was an issue with the recording of the effective date in the VAT register from GL journals which meant that journals may be missing from the MTD report and figures. The date recorded was that of the journal date. This has been fixed in the following versions. Note that system key CEMTDINUSE should be set to YES if system key NLEFFDATE is NO.

    "title": "Fixed Assets - Reducing Balance Depreciation",
    "info": "Created on 08 May 2020 | Last modified on 23 March 2022",
    "content": "Summary How does the Fixed Asset RB% depreciation method work in Sage ERP 1000 and Line 500? Resolution The reducing balance method of depreciation is an alternative to the commonly used straight line (equal amounts each year) method. It is often used for tax purposes, but less often in published accounts. Rather than charging a fixed amount every year, a (fixed) percentage of the remaining value of the asset is charged every year. A £10,000 asset depreciated at 25% a year will be depreciated by £2,500 in the first year, but by 25% × (£10,000 - £2,500) in the second year. Compared to the straight line method, depreciation is more heavily weighted towards early years. Although the reducing balance method usually more closely reflects the actual diminution in the market value of an asset, the straight line method is generally preferred as it better conforms to the principle of matching. If an asset provides the same benefit every year, then the best matching is provided by charging the same depreciation every year. In the UK, writing down allowances (the equivalent to depreciation for tax purposes) on most assets are calculated on a reducing balance basis. The main exceptions are certain buildings, and those assets that are immediately written off in full. By using RB% the user will see that the asset never gets fully written down as the depreciation charge gets smaller every year. If a user wants a definite figure to be charged over 48 periods and a nil written down value at the end they would do better opting for the Straight Line method which would charge £208.33 per month for 48 periods with rounding occurring every now and then.",

    "title": "Paperless performance issues",
    "info": "Created on 06 April 2022 | Last modified on 06 April 2022",
    "content": "Summary This article details possible causes and solutions to issues with Paperless performance. Resolution The first thing to consider is whether the server has the capacity to run Paperless quickly? So long as there is adequate RAM to avoid excessive paging, there shouldn’t be a problem. The biggest offenders for slowing Paperless down are as follows: Nested reports within the Crystal Templates. Make sure the Crystal report templates only read from the Paperless tables (i.e., extra data is linked within Paperless rather than within Crystal). Using a calculated ID for each new DocStore item rather than an internal counter. Using earlier builds of Paperless (Builds prior to 5.0.6698) Undiagnosed exceptions. (If Paperless is crashing a lot – that’s going to slow it down) Other things to consider: It is also worth checking the size of spool.hdr. It may be that excessively large files contain many details of deleted jobs. This can be reset down to a more manageable size from the command line using ‘PaperlessReportServer.exe -purgedeleted’. If Paperless is not on a dedicated machine, it might be worth moving it and having it print directly to printers that are installed locally rather than going via a networked print server. Too many copies of PLManager running can cause contention on spool.hdr. Users should quit PLManager if they are not actively managing jobs. Sometimes problems can relate to slow SMTP servers. There is a timeout of 100 seconds, and SMTP servers can take longer than that to accept the email. Such a delay would be evident in the Debug log. If the Paperless performance is still slow after checking all of the above, then a second server to run in parallel might be necessary. This would require segregated loads which can be achieved by changing the printcmd.ini to push certain types of print jobs to the secondary server. Paperless Debug The only real way to get a handle on what is happening is to look at the logs, and it might be necessary to use the Debug logs for this. The debug logs can give an indication of where most time is lost: While Crystal is opening the report template, some builds of Paperless would close and re-open the template too frequently, causing an avoidable delay. Newer builds are better in this area, it can save several seconds (perhaps 10-20% of the processing time). While Crystal is loading the data, reports that query additional tables from the database will be slower than those that only need to read the Paperless reporting table. While working out the ID to give to the next DocStore item. This could be resolved by add ‘TCRIDLegacyMode=Load’ to Paperless.Ini file. NOTE: Please read below section on setting d ‘TCRIDLegacyMode. The log file collected from a ten-minute interval while the server is stressed should suffice for analysis. Build 5.1.7723 adds some extra messages to the Debug Log to show some performance timings: Time to open the template Time to validate the database connection Time to read the records Time to print Total time per document. Setting TCRIDLegacyMode You need to take care if using the TCRIDLegacyMode setting in the Paperless.ini file. If Paperless is the only system that adds data to the TCR.AttachInfo table, then maintaining the counter inside Paperless makes sense: Permitted values for TCRIDLegacyMode are: Yes Use the NextTCRID value from the Setup table in the Paperless definitions database No Derive the next ID for the AttachInfo table by examining existing records This can be (very) slow on large TCR databases Load Derive the NextTCRID by examining existing records and then increment this counter for subsequent records. The value in Paperless.INI will be updated to be ‘Yes’ after the value has been loaded. If there are other programs writing entries to the TCR.AttachInfo table (such as adding Attachments via Sage ERP 1000) then this must be set to ‘No’. However, there is still scope to speed things up with adding additional indexing to that table so “scanning existing records” might be executed more efficiently.",

    "info": "Created on 26 May 2020 | Last modified on 23 March 2022",
    "content": "Summary In Line 500 and Sage ERP 1000, you can make additional postings to account for these deductions. Description If you employ contractors that work via their own Personal Services Company (PSC) and you have provided an employment status determination that confirms the contractor is a 'deemed employee' and is therefore subject to the off-payroll working rules (IR35), then you're likely to be responsible for deducting tax (PAYE) and National Insurance (NI) via payroll from your worker's fees and paying it to HMRC. The information within this article should be used to supplement any information offered by HMRC. If you're unsure on how to proceed, we recommend consulting with your accountant or HMRC directly. Resolution Create a new IR35 General Ledger posting code We recommend you create a new posting code(s) for IR35 deductions within the Balance Sheet section of your chart of accounts. You can check your chart of accounts in Finance , General Ledger & Analysis , General Ledger, Reports , Chart of Accounts. Use Finance, General Ledger & Analysis, Create / Amend Master Files: Account Codes, Cost Centres, Posting Codes to extend the Chart of Accounts as required. Manage deductions through Sage 50cloud Payroll If you use the Sage 50 Payroll Integration functionality with Line 500/Sage ERP 1000, and you manage deductions as part of your normal payroll processing, there are some nominal link changes and additional postings you must make in Line 500/Sage ERP 1000 to account for the IR35 deduction. Using nominal link To ensure your nominal link posting are correct, within Sage 50cloud Payroll you must you must adjust your nominal link settings to account for the IR35 element. Find out how > Once this is done, the nominal link posts a debit amount to the IR35 deductions General Ledger posting code. In Line 500 / Sage ERP 1000, post the invoice from your contractor as normal, plus a credit note to reduce the amount due by the IR35 deduction you've made. For an example, please refer to the Purchase invoice and credit note example section. Using manual salary journals If you normally post manual salary journals in Line 500/Sage ERP 1000, for any deemed employees you must post the following four journals to account for IR35 deductions: G/L Posting Code Description Debit Credit P1 Employers NI - The total employer NI contribution under IR35. Debit P2 PAYE - The total PAYE deducted under IR35. Credit P3 National Insurance - The total employer and employee NI contribution under IR35. Credit P4 IR35 deduction - The total amount withheld under IR35. Debit Where: P1 is the relevant General Ledger posting code for Employers NI. P2 is the relevant General Ledger posting code for PAYE. P3 is the relevant General Ledger posting code for National Insurance. P4 is the new General Ledger posting code for IR35 deductions. For deemed employees no other journals are required, for example, for gross pay or net pay. You should also post the invoice from your contractor as normal, plus a credit note to reduce the amount due by the IR35 deduction you've made. For an example, please refer to the Purchase invoice and credit note example section. Manage deductions outside of your payroll If you process IR35 deductions separately from your payroll, you should post the invoice from your contractor as normal, plus a credit note to reduce the amount due by the IR35 deduction. For an example, please refer to the Purchase invoice and credit note example section. When you pay the deduction to HMRC, post the bank payment to the new General Ledger posting code for IR35 deductions to clear the liability. If the IR35 deduction is to be offset rather than paid directly to HMRC, you can post further journals to move the balance as required. Purchase invoice and credit note example For the invoice you must use the appropriate VAT code dependant on the supply. Type Date G/L Posting Code Details Net T/C (VAT) Purchase invoice Invoice date G1 Invoice 1000.00 V1 (200.00) Purchase credit note Date IR35 calculations processed G2 IR35 deductions 300.00 V2 (0.00) Where: G1 is the relevant General Ledger posting code for Goods/Services. V1 is the relevant VAT code used as before this legislation. G2 is the new General Ledger posting code for IR35 deductions. V2 is a zero-rated VAT code. If using the Making Tax Digital functionality, this should be flagged as Exempt. When you pay the invoice, you can allocate the credit note and pay the difference to your contractor.",

    "title": "Landed Costs implementation notes",
    "info": "Created on 08 May 2020 | Last modified on 23 March 2022",
    "content": "Description Landed Costs implementation notes Resolution BASIC REQUIREMENTS There is a requirement to be able to reflect the true cost of stock, not just the \"goods\" cost. Some costs, such as freight charges, handling etc. would apply to the whole order or shipment and there needs to be a way of adding these to the stock costs without having to manually calculate them. These costs would have to be apportioned over the receipt. Other costs would apply to specific detail lines on the receipt. A new suspended receipts program was written which would allow the costs that applied to the entire receipt or order to be entered at the header stage. These costs would be apportioned to the detail lines entered on the receipt and could be amended as required until the receipt was posted. The current Goods Receipt program receives each line as it is entered. The existing Landed Cost Matrix and Log File were extended to allow for the addition of an extra 6 costs. NEW OPTIONS Command Description posrecp Suspended Receipts Entry polandnew New Landed Cost Log Entry poadmatnew New Landed Cost Matrix Entry NEW SYSTEM KEYS System Key Description Value POSUSPREC Use Suspended Receipts Entry YES or NO POLANDCOST Cost in use ESTIMATE or ACTUAL POLANDDIM Dimension Apportionment Indicator H, L or W PORECEX Over and under receipt exception trapping OVER, UNDER or BOTH POLINDAPP (01-10) Apportionment Method 1-10. Types are Weight, Dimension, Quantity and Value POLNDDSC (01-10) Descriptions of the apportioned costs in POLINDAPP Free form text POGRNLIST Price list for stock items used for margin calculations SOP Price List Code PORECEXP Expire date/bin number prompt YES or NO PORECINS Allow insertion of duplicate lines YES or NO SYSTEM SET UP The system has to be set up to show how many apportioned costs there are out of the possible 10 Landed Costs. This is done by using the POLNDAPP01-10 system keys. If POLNDAPPO1 is the only system key that exists then this would mean that it would only be possible to enter the one apportioned cost on the header of the receipt. If POLNDAPPOW, POLNDAPP02 AND POLNDAPPO3 exist then the option would be given to enter 3 costs on the header etc. POLNDDSC01, POLNDDSC02, POLNDDSC03 would also need to be set up to describe the costs, EG Freight, Insurance, Handling etc. As these are system wide setting it would mean, in the above example, that the first landed cost would always be Freight, the second would be Insurance and the third would be Handling. If there were certain products/supplier combinations that do not use all the system wide apportioned Landed Costs then this would be shown by entering zero against this cost on the Landed Cost matrix. MATRIX SET UP The set up of the matrix is similar to the original Landed Costs. The Stock G/L category is used with the supplier category to create the matrix entry. The costs that are entered against each line are the estimated costs that the user would expect to pay in addition to the actual goods cost. The estimated costs are loaded at receipt entry time and can be amended if required. FIRST SCREEN The first screen asks for Supplier/Product Categories. The supplier category is taken from the Supplier File and the Product Category is taken from the Stock/GL category field on the stock file. Either of the categories may be blank but you will need a matrix entry for each stock item/supplier combination that will have Landed Costs associated with them. DETAIL SCREEN After accepting the supplier and product categories you will have to enter details of the Landed Costs associated with this matrix. With POLNDAPP01, POLNDAPP02 and POLNDAPP03 set up this would mean that the first 3 costs entered would be used for the apportioned costs and if any other costs were entered against line 4 to 10 then these would apply on a line by line basis to the receipt. The screen looks similar to this: Estimated Value Cost Type Percentage Calculation Cost Multiple Debit Account Credit Account 10 q 100 x-xx-xxx x-xx-xxx 20 v 1000 x-xx-xxx x-xx-xxx 5 w 500 x-xx-xxx x-xx-xxx 10 p 12V The Estimated Value field should hold the estimated cost for this supplier/product combination for each Landed Cost. This is always entered in base currency. The first line in this example would hold the cost for Freight, the second for Insurance and the third for a cost associated with the detail line. The Cost Type could be either, 'q' quantity, ‘p’ percentage, ‘v’ value, ‘d’ dimension or ‘w’ weight. This field is used with the Cost Multiple field to calculate the estimated cost. If the calculation is by dimension then the stock record would have to have any amount entered in the field specific by the POLANDDIM system key. The Percentage Calculation is used when the cost type is set to ‘p’. A cost type of ‘p’ means that the estimated value entered is a percentage and you need to enter what you want this to be a percentage of. The percentage calculation can be made on the value of the goods line or its value, plus any of the other Landed Costs that are above the percentage calculation in the matrix. If ‘V’ is entered in this field then it would mean that the fourth estimated cost would be equal to 10% of the goods value of the line. If 123V was entered then it would mean that the 10% would be calculated on the line value + the freight charge + the insurance change + the handling charge. You could enter 1V, 12V, 2V, 23V etc. but not 5V as the calculation on a cost can only be made on costs that appear higher up the matrix. The Debit and Credit accounts are the GL account codes that these costs should be posted to. They are posted with the GL Distribution Analysis/Post from within Inventory Control. For Example: If a receipt entry was being made for an order that had the following line on it: 200 items @ £500 each (where each item weighs 2KG) then the following costs would be estimated against this line: · Estimated cost for freight could be £10 per 100 units, therefore the estimated freight cost for this line would be £20 (200 units). · Estimated cost for insurance would be £20 per £1000. The line value would be £100,000 (200x500) and the insurance cost would therefore be £2,000. · Estimated cost for handling would be £5 per 500KG. This line weighs in 1000KG so the estimated cost would be £10. · Fourth line cost (which could be duty) is calculated as 10% of the goods value + freight + insurance = 10% (100,000 + 20 + 2000) = £10,202. These costs are the ESTIMATED Landed Costs for this order line. In Suspended Receipt entry the first 3 could be overwritten by the actual values entered on the order header and the 4 th cost could be amended on the detail line. A later example in this document shows how to do this. STOCK ITEMS All stock items have to have a valid entry in the matrix to allow for Landed Costs to be entered against them. The Stock GL category can be blank as long as the supplier has a category against it. A value has to be entered in the weight or ‘dimension’ field (as specified by POLANDDIM) if apportionment is to take place by weight. SUSPENDED RECEIPTS POSUSPREC has to be set to YES to use this program. The original PO receipts entry program updates stock on a line by line basis - as soon as the line is accepted the stock is updated. The new Suspended Receipt program does not make any updates until it is posted. This means that it can be amended as often as required until it is posted. As Purchase orders may be amended or deleted after a receipt has been entered, the Suspended Receipts program runs a ‘dummy’ posting before the actual posting takes place. It will flag any changes to the relevant purchase orders that have been made between the report being made and being posted. It provides 2 reports - one on the dummy post and one on the ‘live’ posting. A Suspended Receipt can be made for multiple suppliers and multiple purchase orders. To allow entry of Landed Costs a shipment reference has to be entered. If a shipment reference is not entered then no Landed Cost may be entered and the program will appear to be similar to the old receipts program, but it will still make the updates in the manner listed above. If a shipment reference is entered then a screen will appear asking for a vessel name and for other narrative details - Embarkation Port, Leave Date, Arrival Port and Arrival Date. After accepting this information the fields for inputting the costs that are to be apportioned are brought up. In this example there would be 3 lines to allows the costs to be entered as system keys POLNDAPP01 through to POLNDAPP03 exist. If there were more POLNDAPP system keys then a line to enter a cost would appear for each of these. These fields are used to enter the ACTUAL Apportioned costs as opposed to the ESTIMATED costs entered on the matrix, A later example in this document shows how to do this. The suppliers who will be charging for the freight, insurance and handling charges should be entered here (as opposed to the suppliers of goods) and the currency before updating the stock record. The conversion rate from the currency file may be used by pressing F7, alternatively the conversion rate may be typed in. There is a narrative field for an optional invoice reference to be entered. After accepting this information the screen asking for the supplier and purchase order number is brought up. Browse is available on the fields. After entering a supplier and purchase order number the following fields appear. · Deliver no - A narrative field · Allocate all - As F4 in standard PO receipts with the exception that the lines may be modified. · Land edit - Do you wish to be able to modify the Landed Costs held against each detail line. This applies to those Landed Costs that are specifically for the purchase order line rather than the apportioned costs entered on the header (in the above example this would be in the 10% duty entered as cost 4). If ‘n; is entered here then the costs from the matrix would be entered. If ‘y’ is entered then the costs may be amended on each detail line. F9 on these fields and the screen listing the detail lines will be shown. These may be amended as required. Apportioned Landed Costs are not usually apportioned until the posting stage as changes can be made that will affect the apportionment. If you wish to see what the apportionment costs would be at a certain time then F7 will apportion the header costs to the orders entered on the Suspended Receipt. The Apportioned Cost is calculated by totalling the receipt and then apportioning across the lines, e.g. if you had an order with 2 line on it: 20 of item a (that weigh 2 kg each) at a cost of £5 each 60 of item b (that weigh 1 kg each) at a cost of £5 each and the apportioned costs were £1,000 by value, £500 by quantity and £200 by weight, the calculations would be as follows: a. for value apportionment: total receipt value = (20*5) + (60*5) = £400 line 1 value = 20*5 - £100 line 1 value as percentage of whole = (100/400) *100 = 25% Apportion value for line 1 = 25% of £1,000 = £250 line 2 value = 60*5 = £300 line 2 value apportioned cost value = 75% of £1,000 = £750 b. for weight apportionment total receipt weight = (20*2) + (60*1) = £100kg line 1 weight = 20*2 = 40kg line 1 weight as a percentage of whole = (40/100) * 100 = 40% Apportion cost for weight = 40% of £200 = £80 line 2 weight = 60*1 = 60kg line 2 weight as a percentage of whole = (60/100) * 100 = 60% Apportioned cost for weight of line 2 = 60% of 200 = £120 c. for quantity apportionment total receipt quantity =80 line 1 quantity = 20, as a % = 25% 25% of £500 = £125 line 2 quantity = 60, as a % = 75% 75% of £500 = £375 The suspended receipt may be saved so that further changes can be made or it may be posted. To post the receipt enter CONFIRM and this will then go through the dummy and live postings as detailed earlier. The stock cost will be updated with the goods amount and the various landed cost amounts. Postings to the GL for Landed Costs take place in the same manner as usual - they are posted when the Stock module updates GL. OVER AND UNDER RECEIPTS If a receipt is entered for more or less than the ordered quantity, it is possible to flag this as an over or under receipt and assign a code to this, by setting the system key PORECEX. This key can be set to OVER, UNDER or BOTH. If it is set to OVER then when an over receipt is made the user will be prompted to enter a code against it, etc. If the key is blank or missing then the user is not prompted to enter a code. The codes are set up in the Supplier Returns code screen in General Supporting Files. EXPIRY DATES AND BIN NUMBERS If the system key PORECEXP is set to YES then the user will be prompted to enter an Expiry date and bin number on the receipt line. This will then be used as the default when entering the batch details. MULTIPLE EXPIRY DATES AND BIN NUMBERS If the system key PORECINS is set to YES then the user may assign more than one bin number and Expiry date to a received order line. To do this the user would to press the F12 function key to duplicate the order line on the receipt, and then enter the quantity, bin number and Expiry date. The line can be duplicated as many times as required. MARGIN CALCULATIONS Customer required a facility to calculate the margin costs of goods against a specific price list. To use the feature a price list has to set up in SOP that lists all the relevant stock items and prices. The system key POGRNLIST should then be set to point to this price list. When the GRN is printed the margin calculations may be printed, based on calculations made on this price list. The customer’s margin calculation is worked out as follows: %margin = (Selling Price - Landed Cost/Selling price) * 100 EXAMPLE A purchase order is raised against one supplier for: 20 Computers @ £1,000 each, weighing 100KG 5 Printers @ £500 each, weighing 50KG 10 User Guides @ £10 each weighing 1KG 60 Tapes @ £20 each, weighing 1KG A second purchase order is raised against a different supplier for 20 Desks @ £200 each, weighing 10KG 20 Chairs @ £100 each, weighing 5KG A third purchase order is raised against the same supplier for 50 Boxes of Paper @ £10 each, weighing 20KG 25 Ribbons @ £5 each, weighing 1KG These have all been shipped on the same shipment. The shipment usually has a charge for freight which is calculated by weight at a cost of £2 per 10KG, insurance is provided by a French broker for the entire shipment, this is calculated on the value of the goods, at 150ff (£15 local currency) per £1,000, and the shipyard charges a handling charge for unloading the goods - this charge is by quantity at £1 per 10 items. These costs would apply to the whole shipment. In addition there is a 20% duty charged on computer equipment and freight charges relating to the computer equipment. There is a 10% duty on furniture and an additional package charge for chairs and desks at £1 each. No duty is charged for stationary. 1. Set up the POLNDAPP01, POLNDAPP02 and POLNDAPP03 system keys for the freight, insurance and handling. 2. POLNDAPP01 should be set to w and POLNDDSC01 should be set to Freight. 3. POLNDAPP02 should be set to v and POLNDDSC02 should be set to Insurance. 4. POLNDAPP03 should be set to q and POLNDDSC03 should be set to Handling. 5. Set up GL new GL posting codes for the debit and credit entries for the 3 matrices that you will be creating so that you can see the postings being made to GL. 6. Set up a FFR currency with a conversion factor of 10. 7. Set up suppliers for the Landed Costs (reight, insurance and handling - with the insurance supplier having a FFR currency) and suppliers for the purchase order. 8. Set up 3 Landed Cost matrices - the first 3 costs would be the same on each matrix. A. Enter a matrix with a blank supplier category and a new product category that will be used for the computer equipment. Estimated Value Cost Type Percentage Calculation Cost Multiple Debit Account Credit Account 2 w 10 x-xx-xxx x-xx-xxx 15 v 1000 x-xx-xxx x-xx-xxx 1 q 10 x-xx-xxx x-xx-xxx 20 p IV x-xx-xxx x-xx-xxx B. Enter a matrix with a blank supplier category and a new product category that will be used for the furniture. Estimated Value Cost Type Percentage Calculation Cost Multiple Debit Account Credit Account 2 w 10 x-xx-xxx x-xx-xxx 15 v 1000 x-xx-xxx x-xx-xxx 1 q 10 x-xx-xxx x-xx-xxx 10 p V x-xx-xxx x-xx-xxx 1 q 1 x-xx-xxx x-xx-xxx C. Set up a matrix for the stationary. Estimated Value Cost Type Percentage Calculation Cost Multiple Debit Account Credit Account 2 w 5 x-xx-xxx x-xx-xxx 10 v 1000 x-xx-xxx x-xx-xxx 1 q 20 x-xx-xxx x-xx-xxx 9. Create the stock records for the various items, ensuring that the correct weight is entered against each and that the correct product category used on the Landed Cost matrix is entered against the relevant stock item - user guides and ribbons are classified as stationary. 10. Enter the 3 purchase orders for the quantities detailed above and print these. 11. When the shipment arrives the freight charges have been calculated as £3645 the insurance as 304250 FF and the handling charge as £210. 12. Enter the suspended receipt and enter a shipment reference and vessel name. Enter the apportioned Landed Costs from point 5 above with the correct supplier numbers and F7 to pick up the currency for the insurance supplier. 13. Enter the first supplier and purchase order number and allocate all ‘y’ and Landed Cost edit ‘y’. F9 on the first detail line and you will see that the Landed Cost calculations have been made on the estimates from the matrix - note the user guides do not have a 4 th Landed Cost for duty as their matrix entry does not include duty. 14. Enter the other 2 purchase orders and F7 to apportion. Call up the first order again and F9 on the line to see the details. The apportioned costs will have been apportioned across the receipt using the calculation method described above. 15. The receipt may be suspended by F1 from the CONFIRM screen or if you enter CONFIRM it will post. 16. Run the Stock/GL distributions to see the postings that will take place to GL. Check the current cost of the stock items - these will include the Landed Costs. 17. Create a batch tracked item that would use the computer equipment Landed Cost matrix. 18. Set PORECEXP to YES and PORECINS to YES. 19. Raise an order for this product, enter a suspended receipt and on the detail line you will be given a function key F12. Press this to duplicate the line on the order. Enter a quantity against each line. You will be prompted to enter a bin number and expiry date. 20. Set PORECINS to NO and repeat 19. The F12 duplicate line option will not work. 21. Set up a valid supplier returns code and set PORECEX to OVER. 22. Enter a PO and print it. 23. Enter a suspended receipt, set allocate all to ‘n’ and enter a received quantity that is more than the ordered quantity. Confirm the posting and you will be prompted to enter a valid code to flag this receipt. If you have PORECEX set to UNDER then only under receipts will be flagged, it you have set to BOTH then both over and under receipts will be flagged. Upgrading your licence Need a little more room?

    "content": "Summary This article details the cause of the Integration error \"Credit controller cannot be blank\" Resolution 2021-11-15 17:11:00,844 [57] ERROR SyncResults [(null)] - Diagnostic:- Error Sequence: 1, Diagnosis Code: ApplicationDiagnosis, Applictaion Code: Unable to update target entity, Error Message: Error: Code (-1), Location (0), RowID (), ColumnName () Message: Credit controller cannot be blank, Payload Path: http://servername/sdata/sage1000j/crmERP/-/tradingAccount/$ syncSource?trackingId=2880e47b-8adb-489e-a19f-5c7ff538251 If your Integration is failing and you see the above error in the integration log file, then this will be due to having Project DA01308 enabled and DA0417 disabled. With this combination the credit controller field in customer entry becomes mandatory. If left blank in ERP you will get the popup message “Credit Controller cannot be blank”. In order for an account to create, you have to force the apiuser to create a default Credit Controller. This is done by putting an initial value in the controller field against the UIG formset. This is the formset used by the apiuser when accounts are created in CRM using the API. The credit control being created against all your accounts is going to be taken from this field. Setting up CK Credit Management on Integrated Sage1000 V4 Projects DA1308 and DA0417 relate to the Credit Management (CK) Module in Sage ERP 1000. By enabling DA1308, CK Credit Controllers will govern the use of Credit Details section of Customer Maintenance option – see below. By disabling DA0417, in conjunction with enabling DA1308, then access to the credit category and credit limit fields are determined by the setting up of Credit Controllers associated with specific ERP User Profiles Sage 1000 V4 integration uses Sage’s APIs to populate ERP Customers by calling ERP Customer Maintenance option. This means that the API user, typically “apiuser”, must have access to the Credit Category and Credit Limit fields. It must also populate the Credit Controller field with a valid CK Credit Controller. The interaction of Credit Management interactions with Customer Maintenance means that the following configuration needs to be set up for the APIs to work: 1) DA1308 enabled, DA0417 disabled, logged-in as a CK Controller. 2) The API User has to be set up as a CK Credit Controller with Alter Credit Limit ticked 3) The API user has to have a default Credit Controller – this is done by adding an Initial Value to the credit_controller field in the API-user’s UIG sl,customer_maint,page1 form in GUI Form Designer 4) Check that the Credit Detail fields in the ERPTxxx Template Customer are set up correctly – the List of fields propagated to new Customers when setting them up as a new CRM Company and Account are detailed in the V4 Integration Guide. 5) Restart the API COM+ service for the change to take effect.",

    "content": "Summary This communication was sent to our Sage 50, Sage 200, Sage X3, Sage Intacct and Sage 1000 Partner communities. Description This communication was sent 25 February 2022. Upcoming Legislation: Plastic Packaging Tax & Hospitality VAT Rates There are a number of upcoming legislation changes. As a Sage Partner, it’s important you’re aware of these changes and have all of the information you need to hand, ensuring you can support customers and help them manage these changes. Plastic Packaging Tax From 1 April 2022, a new tax on plastic packing will come into force for UK businesses. It is anticipated that this new Tax will affect around 20,000 UK manufacturers, producers and importers of plastic packaging, as well as the wider supply-chain. Due to the anticipated customer type including the nature of the industries involved, this is more likely to affect customers using: Sage 50 Accounts Sage 200 Sage 1000 Sage X3 Find out what businesses need to know about the changes in this blog post. Our teams are currently working in conjunction with HMRC to provide information and guidance on this. Our Compliance Help Centre will be updated with all of our supporting material over the coming weeks. Hospitality VAT Rates On 1st October 2021 , the government introduced a reduced rate of VAT to support businesses in the UK recover post lockdown. From 2nd April 2022 , the temporarily reduced rate of VAT 12.5% will be removed and the 20% VAT rate will be reinstated.

    "title": "Sage 1000 Data Agent",
    "info": "Created on 08 May 2020 | Last modified on 23 March 2022",
    "content": "Summary What does the Data Agent do and how does it work? Resolution The Data Agent is used to keep the Front Office (CRM) and Back Office (Fin&Ops) data syncronised – specifically the Account and Trading Account entities. If a user updates a Sage 1000 Account > Customer Details or Addresses or Phone/E-mail details, then the underlying Fin&Ops Trading Account must be updated as well. Unfortunately, the ASP Pages cannot do this in a transactional manor, so Data Agent is used to initiate the updates. The Data Agent is configured via the Sage1000\\DataAgent\\DataAgentConfigure.exe, or manually by editing the Sage1000\\DataAgent\\DataAgentConfig.xml file – please refer to the Sage1000Fin_Ops_System_Admin Guide. The Data Agent launches the Customer API and this logs into Sage 1000 using the configured Sage 1000 User (typically \"dxagent\") and connects to the Sage 1000 Database using the configured Database User (typically “sa”). Please note that the Data Agent User (dxagent) must not be used as a normal Sage 1000 User – it is solely for Data Agent. In order to access all Trading Accounts, this User must have the World-wide Territory in User Details, and must have the UIG Formset in User Profiles. If the Sage 1000 Administrator is concerned about the security of the Sage 1000 Data Agent User, then they can change the User's Password in Administration>Users  – they must ensure that the Fin&Ops User Profile’s Password is updated as well. Once a Password is assigned, then the Data Agent Configuration must be updated to hold the Password – the easiest way would be to amend the DataAgentUserPwd value in DataAgentConfig.xml – and then re-start the Data Agent service. If the Sage 1000 Administrator is concerned about the security of the Sage 1000 Data Agent SQL Account, then they can create a new SQL Account with permissions to update Sage1000 database, and then change the Data Agent Configuration to use that SQL Account instead of  “sa” – again, this can be done by editing the Sage1000DatabaseUser and Sage1000DatabasePwd values in the DataAgentConfig.xml Troubleshooting The Data Agent Service can report errors to the Application Log in Windows Event Viewer: 1) Sql Failure:Login failed for user 'sa’ This is normally due to the Data Agent not being configured with the correct Database Password. 2)  Exception when trying to log in to Sage 1000: Password failure or user already logged in This is normally related to the Sage 1000 Data Agent User (dxagent) having a Sage 1000 password which doesn’t match the one in the Configuration File, or the Data Agent User has been set up with a Password Policy which requires the changing of the User’s Password. The Sage 1000 User should be set up without a Password Policy, and the Configuration File must be updated with  the correct DataAgentUserPwd before re-starting the Data Agent Service.",

    "content": "Summary This communication was issued to our Sage Partner and Developer communities for all products. Description This communication was sent 07 February 2023. Notice 23-HK | 07 February 2023 As part of our strategy to continually improve our customer experience, we will enhance our Sage Identity Service (Sage Account) platform (known as Sage ID) on Saturday, February 18 . These improvements will require downtime of up to four hours, making many products and services unavailable during this time. The planned downtime window is from 20:00 to midnight UTC. The downtime window was chosen as it is the quietest period in terms of usage so hopefully will result in minimal impact. It may be necessary to re-login to accounts when the Sage Identity Service platform is back up and running. As a result, we encourage everyone to confirm their account username and password prior to the planned downtime. Where passwords are unknown, please go through the usual forgotten password processes and update them prior to the downtime. Where a product has 2-Factor Authentication (2FA) and a customer has enrolled in it, we suggest they confirm access to a recovery code and/or have a backup method (secondary email or phone number) setup on the account. We’ve set up a dedicated article that outlines what this means for each product. We will write to customers via email on 8 February and will update in-product messaging too, where available, to notify them of this maintenance. Progress can be tracked on the day via https://status.sage.com/ . If you require support once the authentication platform is back up and running, please visit the dedicated pages and, if you still require support, please contact our support teams via the usual channels. We apologise for any inconvenience this might cause.",

    "title": "Intrastat legislation changes from 1 January 2022",
    "info": "Created on 14 December 2021 | Last modified on 21 July 2023",
    "content": "Summary If you're based in the UK, this guide explains the upcoming changes to Intrastat reporting within the EU and Northern Ireland from 1 January 2022. Description What is Intrastat reporting? Intrastat is the system used to track the trade of goods between countries of the European Union. It's used by governments for statistical and anti-fraud purposes. VAT registered businesses in the EU and Northern Ireland, with relevant imports and exports above the Intrastat thresholds, must submit Intrastat dispatches and arrivals reports. Since Brexit, currently businesses in Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) only need to submit arrivals Intrastat reports. What's changing from 1 January 2022? There are changes to three key areas of Intrastat that businesses need to be aware of. Great Britain will no longer be covered by Intrastat During 2021, businesses in Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) were required to submit arrivals Intrastat reports. From 1 January 2022, movements of goods between Great Britain and the EU, or Great Britain and Northern Ireland, are no longer covered by Intrastat. TIP: Northern Ireland businesses are still covered by Intrastat as part of the Northern Ireland Protocol. Intrastat threshold changes From 1 January 2022 the thresholds above which Northern Ireland businesses must complete Intrastat declarations will be: £500,000 for imports from the EU, known as arrivals. £250,000 for exports to the EU, known as dispatches. Additional information required for dispatches Businesses in the EU or Northern Ireland with exports above the dispatch threshold must include the following additional information in their dispatch Intrastat reports from 1 January 2022: Partner VAT ID This is a combination of the 2 digit country code for the EU country the goods are despatched to, followed by the customer's VAT number. For example, EL123456789. More information EU country codes > Verify EU VAT numbers > EU VAT number format checker > Country of Origin (CoO) The 2 digit country code for the country where the goods are deemed to originate from. This is where they were originally manufactured or produced. Where goods were produced in more than one country, the CoO is the country where the last substantial economic transformation took place. More information EU country codes > Rest of World country codes > Who's affected by the changes? Businesses in Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) will no longer need to submit any Intrastat reports. Businesses in Northern Ireland and the EU should be aware of the amended Intrastat thresholds and those who exceed the dispatch threshold must include the additional Partner VAT ID and Country of Origin information in their dispatch report. What do I need to do? For a detailed guide on how to include the additional information in your dispatch report, simply visit our dedicated Legislation Help Centre and select which Sage software you use.",

An example of this would be allocating a sales order. Soft allocation is when an allocation has been made and written to the stockm table, so it shows on the product record, but no entry is written to stallocm and therefore numerous soft allocations can be made for the same product regardless of the free stock position. An example of this would be creating a works order. Upgrading your licence Need a little more room?

    "title": "How to use multiple email addresses in a field within SRD",
    "info": "Created on 08 May 2020 | Last modified on 23 March 2022",
    "content": "Description How can SRD use multiple email addresses stored in one field? Resolution SRD cannot interpret multiple email addresses in in a single database field – for example, it will error if the Supplier Email field is set up to have a list of comma-separated or semi-colon separated addresses such as purchasing@my_company.co.uk,warehousing@my_supplier.co.uk \" – instead, each address must be on separate lines within a Report's Email Options > To or Email Options > CC property. Solution There are two ways to produce an email list: 1)   Set up each email-address in a separate filed and reference all the relevant fields in Email Options For Example: Assume the Buyer’s Telephone and Supplier’s Email fields are set to single email addresses 2)   Set up a list of email addresses in one or more fields as necessary, and generate a list of SRD Expressions to use in Email Options. Use Expression Fields to create variables with substrings. For example: Assuming the Supplier email address field has the potential to have multiple addresses in a comma-separated list, then Purchase Orders can be emailed to that list of addresses using the following steps: 1)   In POP PO Print Report Definition, create a new Expression called Expr1 based on rpt_email field. 2)   Make the Expression’s value into a sub-string from the start to the character before a  comma substring(v__rpt__po__po__printing__draw__pick__list__title.rpt_email, 0, IndexOf(v__rpt__po__po__printing__draw__pick__list__title.rpt_email,,\",\")) Substring (string, sub-start, sub-end) where start and end positions are relative to zero as the first character rather than one. IndexOf (string, pattern) where pattern can be a number of characters. 3)  Create a second Expression called Expr2 which is the rpt_email field without the first address 3)  Create a second Expression called Expr2 which is the rpt_email field without the first address substring(v__rpt__po__po__printing__draw__pick__list__title.rpt_email, IndexOf(v__rpt__po__po__printing__draw__pick__list__title.rpt_email,,\",\")+1) 4)  Create a third Expression, Expr3, which is a substring of Expr2 and will contain the second email address substring(Expr2,0,IndexOf(Expr2,,\",\")) 5)  Create a fourth Expression, Expr4 which is Expr2 without the second email address. substring(Expr2,Length(Expr3)+1) 6)  Additional Expression can be created to cope with more than three email-addresses. 7)  The Expr1, Expr3 Expr4 expressions can be added to the \"To\" or \"CC\" email dialog in SRD.",

    "content": "Summary This communication was issued 01 May 2020.  Sage Line 500 / Sage ERP 1000 - Essential software maintenance Resolution Dear partner, Sage is committed to keeping our customers secure. Making sure we reduce threats and take advantage of the latest technology. Meaning from time to time we need to upgrade the underlying components of our products. Important Note: We have key changes to make which will impact the following products: Sage Line 500 Sage ERP 1000 What are the upcoming changes? Vendors are removing TLS 1.0 / 1.1 from their supported range of software; this includes Operating Systems and browsers. TLS is a security protocol required for the application to function. It enables the product installation, the APIs and the integration with Sage CRM to communicate securely. What does this mean for my business & customers? An upgrade to a supported version will be required. Where an upgrade to a supported version is not possible, then it will be the responsibility of the user to check whether TLS 1.0 / 1.1 can remain enabled on the operating system version or browsers (i.e. Internet Explorer) being used and also understand the security risks and implications this may entail. For any sites where TLS 1.0 / 1.1 has been deactivated either manually in line with business IT policy, by operating system or browser software updates, new implementations or full-service pack upgrades, the product installers will no longer complete successfully. In addition, the integration with Sage CRM will also cease to function. You can find out more about Sage CRM in our separate communication . Please note that there is no impact for customers not using our product APIs via the Sage CRM integration or other specific integrations. What is Sage doing to support customers? Customers not using Integrated CRM New product installers and new API installers will be made available for the following versions: Sage ERP 1000 v3 SP13 and SP14 Updated APIs Updated product installers (SP14 only) Sage ERP 1000 v4 SP10 and SP11 Updated APIs for Sage ERP 1000 v4 SP10 and SP11 Updated product installers (SP11 only) Line 500 v7.1 Updated Line 500 v7.1 APIs Updated product installers (Windows Server 2016) Customers using Integrated CRM New product installers, new API installers and new CRM updates will be made available for the following versions: Sage ERP 1000 v4 SP10 and SP11 Updated APIs for Sage ERP 1000 v4 SP10 and SP11 ERP 1000 V4 SP11 will be tested against CRM 2020 R1.1 ERP 1000 V4 SP10 will be tested against CRM 2018 R3.3 Please note: We will not be producing updates for Sage 1000 v2.x What are the key dates? TLS is not technology provided by Sage – the dates will vary dependant on the operating system, browser and business policy and as such is outside our control. Got a question? Please speak to our Customer Services Team in the first instance. Kind regards, Jo Kirkup Product Manager",

    "info": "Created on 16 February 2021 | Last modified on 23 March 2022",
    "content": "Summary This article describes how it is possible to process the new CIS Reverse Charge VAT legislation on all versions of Sage ERP 1000 and Line 500.  New functionality will be available on the latest versions in a hot fix shortly. Description NOTE: T he government delayed the date to which this legislation comes into action from October 2019 to 1st March 2021, more information can be found here . The way in which VAT is charged on construction services will change from 1st March 2021, as a result of new anti-fraud rules. This will impact domestic supplies (UK Only) where payments are reported under the 'Construction Industry Scheme', more specifically supplies of services that are Standard Rate (20%) or Reduced Rate (5%). Resolution General Limitations and Considerations The customer (user) must manually check to ensure that all invoice lines in all modules are for CIS Reverse Charge VAT codes or none of them are. Existing quotes, orders and invoices created prior to 1st March should be checked to see whether any VAT codes need to be amended Making Tax Digital Accounts Payable Only Accounts Payable transactions have any impact on the MTD Tax reports and Tax return The  customer (user) is expected to know which transactions it applies to Setting up a new Purchase CIS Reverse Charge VAT code Go to General Configuration - Create / Amend Master Files - VAT Configuration - VAT Code Create a new VAT code (for example PVC) and enter a description and a VAT rate of 0 Enter valid GL control code and set the Ledger to Accounts Payable Press F2 browse on the VAT service and pick up your VAT service code Press F3 to access the Extra Details for MTD screen Set the Sales EC and Purchase EC fields to No Tick the Domestic reverse charge box.  If you are on MTD version 1.2 or below the box will be titled Purchase reverse charge.   It is the same field and should be ticked.

They will update boxes 1, 3, 4 and 7 of the MTD Return Purchase Order Processing The customer (user) must manually check to ensure that all invoice lines are for CIS Reverse Charge VAT codes or none of them are. This is a HMRC limitation Products and Services are supported for Purchase Invoices Once the VAT matrix is set to pick up your CIS VAT code invoicing will proceed as normal Adding the Purchase CIS VAT code to the VAT Matrix The basic steps required are shown below.  Time should be taken at this stage to review which combination of products, services and account types will require the reverse charge for Purchases and Sales and how this impacts the current entries in the VAT Matrix. Go to General Configuration - Create / Amend Master Files - VAT Configuration - Item VAT Type Maintenance Create a new CIS item VAT code (for example CIS) with a description Go to General Configuration - Create / Amend Master Files - VAT Configuration - Account Type Maintenance Create a new Account VAT code (for example PVC) with a description Go to General Configuration - Create / Amend Master Files - VAT Configuration - VAT Matrix Maintenance Create a new entry of CIS for the item type and PVC for the VAT type of the customer or supplier Enter a description and F2 browse and pick up your Purchase CIS VAT code (for example PVC) Adding the Item VAT code to a product Go to Inventory Control - Create / Amend Files - Full Stock Details For each of your products add the new Item VAT code to the VAT type field on Page 1 Adding the Item VAT code to a Service Go to Purchase Order Processing - Create / Amend Files - Services For each of your services add your new Item VAT code to the VAT type field Adding the Account VAT code to a Supplier Go to Accounts Payable - Create / Amend Master Files - Supplier Files - Suppliers Enter your supplier and on Page 1 add your Account VAT Type to the VAT type field Accounts Receivable If you are entering invoices directly you can use any zero VAT rated code but it is advisable to create a new code for CIS invoices If you are entering invoices through Sales Order Processing or Telesales then you must create a new CIS VAT code and set up DA1407 (see the section below) Setting up a new Sales CIS VAT code Go to General Configuration - Create / Amend Master Files - VAT Configuration - VAT Codes Create a new VAT code (for example SVC) and enter a description and a VAT rate of 0 Enter valid GL control code and set the Ledger to Accounts Receivable Press F2 browse on the VAT service and pick up your VAT service code Press F3 to access the Extra Details for MTD screen Set the Sales EC and Purchase EC fields to No Press Confirm twice to create your new code Sales Ledger Invoices on the MTD Tax Report CIS invoices appear on the report in the same way as other zero rated invoices They will update box 6 on the MTD Return Sales Order Processing and Telesales Order Entry Limitations Services and Credit Notes will require the reverse charge VAT to be manually calculated and added as a comment line.  If you need to use either we strongly recommend patching to the CIS hotfix which supports both. The customer (user) must manually check to ensure that all invoice lines are for CIS Reverse Charge VAT codes or none of them are. This is a HMRC limitation The workaround will not support the use or postings for offering Early Settlement Discount. Service Codes will either need to be created as Products or a manual comment line added to Sales Invoices Sales Credits will need to have to the Reverse Charge manually calculated and added as a comment line The workaround will not take into account VAT Inclusive Pricing The workaround does not take into account Order Header Discounts across VAT codes Setting up Project DA1407 License the project in System Manager - System Administration - Company Management - Working Directories Create a new Sales CIS VAT code (as per instructions above) if this has not already been done Note your existing standard 20% Sales VAT code.  This can be found in General Configuration - Create / Amend Master Files - VAT Configuration - VAT Codes Create new system key OPRCVATSVC (if your new VAT code is SVC if not replace the last three characters with your VAT code) in System Manager - System Key Maintenance - All System Keys Set the value of your new system key to be a 0 followed by your standard Sales VAT code.  For example 0,SV Adding the Sales CIS VAT code to the VAT Matrix The basic steps required are shown below.  Time should be taken at this stage to review which combination of products and account types will require the reverse charge for Sales and Purchasing and how this impacts the current entries in the VAT Matrix.

    "content": "Summary This communication was issued to our Business Partner community. Description This communication was sent 31 March 2021. Upcoming legislation changes Notice 21-BR | 31 March 2021 Dear Partner, There are a number of upcoming changes that will effect users of Sage software in different ways. As a Sage Partner, it’s essential you’re aware of these changes and have all of the information you need to hand, ensuring you can support customers and help them manage through these changes. Which products does this communication cover? Sage Business Cloud Accounting Sage 50 Accounts Sage 200cloud Sage Intacct Sage X3 Sage ERP 1000 TAS Deferred VAT Payments Following the announcement in the budget earlier this month, businesses that deferred their VAT payments between 20 March and 30 June 2020, will be required to settle the relating balance by 31 Match 2021. Instead of paying the full amount by the end of March 2021, customers can apply to make up to 11 smaller monthly instalments, interest free. All instalments must be paid by the end of March 2022 and third-party agents cannot apply on behalf of businesses. Use the links below to find out more: Sage Business Cloud Accounting Sage 50 Accounts Sage 200cloud Sage Intacct Sage X3 Sage ERP 1000 TAS End of digital links soft landing period When MTD for VAT was launched, HMRC allowed for a ‘soft landing period’ of one year for businesses to have digital links in place between applications that made up their MTD ‘functional compatible software’. During this period, HMRC accepted the use of ‘copy & paste’ (which is technically manual intervention) to transfer data from one application to another. The soft landing period was further extended by one year due to Covid19. However, as of 1 April 2021, digital links are now mandatory. The end of the soft-landing period means businesses will need to ensure digital links are in place and no manual intervention is required in the MTD process. Click here to find out more about MTD digital links, and what this means for customers. Revised VAT return labels HMRC are amending the UK VAT return labels to better reflect the underlying transactions post-Brexit. This is essentially a change to the wording in the product only, and will not change what is being reported or impact submission data. You can find more about when the Sage software will be updated here . VAT for voluntary filers (XML VAT channel submissions) HMRC are making changes to how VAT returns are submitted and the option to submit VAT returns electronically using XML format will no longer be possible. Making Tax Digital (MTD) will be the simplest way to submit using the existing Sage software, customers will need to register for this service and you can find out more information here . Questions? To prepare for these upcoming changes, you can find useful information using the links in the sections above or alternatively through our new Compliance Help Centre which helps provide the information you need to remain compliant.",

    "info": "Created on 08 May 2020 | Last modified on 23 March 2022",
    "content": "Summary Where are is database access defined? Resolution Database Access can be defined at 3 Levels within Line 500 and Sage 1000 Fin&Ops systems: Global Level User Profile Level User Profile Company Level These settings control the Access for both the Applications and any APIs which are being used. If particular Users get \"cannot establish connection\" for Options in a certain Companies, or \"database_connection_failure” when launching a Sage 1000 API, such as updating a Trading Account, then check the db_user_id and db_user_auth settings in tables usermastm and dbusers. 1. Global Level The User Profile “system” holds the Template settings for all other User Profiles – these include the F6 Papers, and the F7 Info – the latter defines the default Database Account and Password for the System – typically, “scheme” and “password” respectively. By default, all User Profiles will use these credentials to connect to the Company Databases. This information is stored in the “system” User Profile record within csmaster.scheme.usermastm table, in the db_user_id and db_user_auth. 2. User Profile Level The Database Account and Password set for User “system” can be overridden on a User Basis by setting up specific F7-Info for a User Profile – this can be done at the main User details screen. The credentials entered in the F7-Info are used to connect to all Company Databases when logged-in as that User. This information is stored in the User's User Profile record within csmaster.scheme.usermastm table, in the db_user_id and db_user_auth. 3. User Profile Company Level A User’s Database Credentials can be defined for specific Company Databases – these Credentials override the values specified at Global and User Profile Levels. Within User Profiles, select F3-Company button to display a list of Companies; select a particular Company and press F8-Info (do not press F9/CR to go into the Allowed/Disallowed Options screen); a Database User and Password will be prompted-for. This information is stored in the User’s record within csmaster.scheme.dbusersm table for the particular Company Database.",
